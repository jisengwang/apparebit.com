<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>19 years ago, my then partner declared “you need a kitten!” A few weeks
later, he informed me that he had found the perfect kitten on Craigslist. We
headed from <abbr>NYU</abbr>’s faculty housing in the center of the Village over
to the guy’s home in the West Village. The guy had found the kitten, desperate
for food and attention, in a Harlem stoop garden the night before but wasn’t
ready to commit to becoming a cat gay. Alas, the visit didn’t go well. Both
kitten and I were skittish and scared of each other. After heading out
empty-handed, my then partner piped up. This was a mistake, he said. He was
ready to go back and take the kitten home with him himself. After some back and
forth, we went back, took the kitten, and headed home.</p>

<p>As I found out the hard way years later, cat adoptions in New York City
almost never are that easy. They require letters of reference, home visits, and
window screens. Though as I also found out the hard way, you may be able to skip
the window screens. But only if you live in a landmarked building. That’s
because there is one organization that’s more powerful than the crazy cat ladies
who hold a monopoly on cat adoptions in <abbr>NYC</abbr>. Even they bow before
New York City’s Landmarks Protection Commission. Really: My adoption of Prince
David had been on hold for weeks due to window screens. It was approved within
30 minutes of me pointing out my building’s landmark status!</p>

</figure>

<p>But back to that fateful day. Once home, I let the kitten loose in my bedroom
and, whoosh, it vanished underneath the bed, into the corner furthest from our
reach. With the space under the bed packed with boxes for computer, stereo
components, lamps, and the like, the kitten had probably counted on being well
out of reach. So when we just slid the mattress to the side and approached its
hideaway from above, it stared at us from underneath the slats, startled and in
fear. My then partner was not impressed by its state and was about to rudely
grab it and pull it out.</p>

<p>Recognizing just a hint of that infamous curiosity in the kitten’s demeanor,
I stopped him and gave the kitten time and space to come out out on its own
terms. I also started whispering words of encouragement, and soon enough, the
kitten did move towards us and poked its head through the gap between slats. A
moment later, it pulled down again. A few moments later, it makes another
attempt. This time, it goes up higher and stays up longer. Then down again. Up
and down. It sniffs my finger. Up and down. I get to touch it. Up and down. It
curls up into my arm, purring up a storm. That’s how we imprinted on each other.
He the love of my life, me the bitch of his life!</p>

<h2 id=kitten-days>Days of the Kitten</h2>

<p>The first vet visit went well. We had picked up a girl, Anyanka Mathilde
Grimm — Anyanka after Buffy’s friend, a former vengeance demon, and Mathilde
after my mother’s mother. The first bloodwork also went well. Much to my relief,
she was free of viral nasties, including <abbr>FIV</abbr>. The second vet visit
a few weeks later was interesting. She really was a he, the vet said, his bad.
Well hello, Esteban Otto Grimm: You are named after three generations of Esteban
in Pedro Almodovar’s <cite>All About My Mother</cite>—sorry for deadnaming you,
Lola!—and three generations of Otto in the Grimm family, including me.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we live in a state where the first gender impression isn’t
permanently binding and so Esteban got gender-appropriate medical treatment all
his life. It matters. For instance, there is a difference of procedure between
spaying and neutering. As it happens, I didn’t time that appointment quite right
and Esteban went into heat the night before the neutering. Nobody got any sleep
that night, what with Esteban racing through the apartment, scaling off walls,
and screaming at the top of his astonishingly powerful lungs. He was so much
better 24 hours later—chop, chop—without balls!</p>

<p>Other than that crazy night, Esteban was one cool kitten. He kept himself
entertained by exploring the heights of the apartment—the climb up Mount Living
Room Bookshelf ended in a book slide but the route up Mount Cupboard above the
Range became part of his exercise regime. From valley floor up on the Eastern
Counter Ridge onto the Fridge Summit and then a daring jump across the entire
valley onto the Western Cupboard summit. Once up there, Esteban would position
himself next to Godzilla and the two would stare down at us puny humans.</p>

<p>Besides climbing, Esteban also was an avid soccer player. He even invented a
new variant that can be easily played by a team of one. All you need to do is
bring the ball into a bath tub with the shower curtain drawn. Since that’s just
how I usually left it, Esteban would spend many a night kicking the ball up
high. Thanks to the setup, the ball would always bounce right back into the tub
and roll towards Esteban, who’d kick the ball again and so on, all through the
night.</p>

<p>Despite his busy athletic schedule, Esteban also was an exceedingly cuddly
cat. As soon as I reclined in a comfortable position in the living room, he’d
come and climb up on my chest to cuddle. All I had to do was offer one arm as
support and use the other to pet him. He loved every minute of it every single
time, purring loudly—until he had enough, climbed down, and curled up next to
me. It was during one of those cuddle sessions that I wrote a song just for him:
“I love you. You love me. Let’s go outside and pee on a tree.” I still don’t
understand why the song didn’t make the Billboard Hot 100 upon release!</p>
</div>

  <span>and pee</span> <span>on a tree.”</span></span></p>
</aside>-->

<p>While we never went outside and peed on a tree, Esteban and I did venture to
Brooklyn together, nominally for a play date with my then partner’s cat, King
Arthur. Still a kitten, Esteban was so chill that I could just take him with me,
just holding him, no harness, no leash. He loved every minute of it, enjoying
the view from my chest while we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge and, a little
later, exploring every nook and cranny of my then partner’s studio. In fact, he
was so focused on exploring, he completely ignored the purpose of the visit,
playing with King. I guess it didn’t help that King kept following Esteban at
some distance, hissing nonstop.</p>

<figcaption>Synchronized sleeping</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The play date for King at my place a few weeks later wasn’t much of a play
date either. King took one look at the unfamiliar surroundings and vanished
underneath the sofa. Neither words, treats, arms, or broom stick could convince
King to come out again. He stayed put underneath the sofa—until about 24 hours
later, when he emerged and acted like he had always lived there. That way, King
moved in with me months before my then partner. Those disastrous play dates
notwithstanding, King and Esteban became inseparable. They played together. They
ate together. They slept together. They founded the Feline Liberation Front
(<abbr>FLF</abbr>) together. I’m still a bit unclear about the
<abbr>FLF</abbr>’s goals and activities but people in the know tell me that the
State Department came rather close to officially designating the Feline
Liberation Front as a terrorist organization. Something about feline supremacy
and infecting every human with <i lang=la>toxoplasmosis gondii</i> to make us
more beholden to cats.</p>
</div>

<p>Frankly, I find that a bit hard to believe. While King was not adverse to
utilizing biological weapons more or less on a whim, Esteban was a people
person, ahem, cat. The only thing Esteban ever attacked during his life were
those boxes underneath the bed. We heard him tear through them at night. But I
didn’t think much of it because there was no visible damage. At least, as far as
I could tell, peaking under the bed from the side. Hah! When I needed them for
my move to Brooklyn, I realized that all that was left were the visible parts,
towards the side. He had completely shredded the rest, leaving just a pile of
scraps.</p>

<h2 id=community>Esteban, Community Organizer</h2>

<p>Esteban discovered his love for human attention when I extended our daily
fetch sessions to the hallway outside the apartment. It all came together rather
organically. Throwing the ball far enough meant throwing the ball from living
room through hallway or kitchen (which really was a second hallway next to the
actual hallway) into the entrance area and then back again. Well, at some point,
I just opened the apartment door and started throwing the ball out into the
building hallway. The boys loved it. They loved it even more when I started
staging laser shows in the hallway.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, the neighbors got curious about the racket outside their
apartment doors. And once they saw what was going on, they called their children
and those youngins were plainly ecstatic about cats, real live cats being right
there in the hallway. Of course, they wanted to play with them. Esteban loved
it. He basked in all the attention and easily forgave when the youngest of the
youngins didn’t quite know what “gentle” meant at first. In stark contrast, King
thought them all too much. At the first hint of another door opening, he’d bolt
back into the apartment and observe the ensuing dance of the baby banshees from
just far enough so that he could see everything while still being just outside
people’s reach.</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Esteban was only getting started. He really came into his own
after we moved to Brooklyn to our own place at One Hanson Place—well, New York
City real estate being <abbr>NYC</abbr> real estate, 0.3% of that place. Well
before that move, my then partner had also moved into my old apartment and it
was truly great until it wasn’t anymore. So the move to Brooklyn also was a
separation. In a textbook case of hoisting with his own petard, my former
partner’s attempt at claiming Esteban for himself by declaring that “The cats
must not be separated!” resulted in King also moving with Esteban and me.
Esteban took to the new apartment and of course the hallway outside in no
time.</p>

<p>For the first several years after we moved into the newly renovated building,
the 15<sup>th</sup> floor differed from other floors in that we neighbors living
on the same floor formed a real community. It sure helped that two more units
were also owned by gay men. But more than anyone and anything, the one who
created that community, who introduced everyone to each other, and who insisted
that everyone be a part was Esteban. He quickly picked up if the owner was
allergic or shared their premises with a dog, giving them their space. But
everyone else was fair game and, if the door was open, their apartment too. He’d
visit. He’d explore. He’d chill. And he’d exercise—by seeking out the highest
accessible place, usually the top of a door, all 2.5cm or 1inch of it, a feat he
not only pulled off repeatedly at my place but also in 15D.</p>

<figcaption>Esteban’s base of operations</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Esteban was particularly fond of 15K, then occupied by a lovely couple and
their newlyborn twin sons. For years, while the twins’ pram was parked in the
hallway next to their door, it served as Esteban’s  base of operations, where
he’d hang out and also sleep. When their apartment door was open, he’d stroll
right in and head to the twins’ bedroom, making himself comfortable under,
behind, or in one of their beds. King didn’t change his mind about building
hallways and never ventured far from the door—except that one time when he too
came to visit 15D and, while the humans were busy talking, proceeded to pee all
over Malik’s pile of dirty workout clothes—as a laughing Malik told me over the
phone a few minutes after we had left.</p>
</div>

<p>Over the years, the owners of 15D and 15K unfortunately moved on, but that
didn’t impress Esteban. He continued to consider the apartments very much part
of his domain. Malik tells of a contractor who called somewhat frantically
because a cat just walked into the apartment while it was being restored after
major flooding and wouldn’t be shooshed out again. Malik advised the contractor
to just let him be; he would leave when he had enough, which he did. After he
sold, I met the new owners standing outside their apartment, facing the door and
not knowing what to do because between them and the door was Esteban, patiently
waiting for them to finally open the door.</p>

<p>Another time, I was rushing to get ready for a meeting and made sure David,
who had opened the apartment door <em>again</em>, was back inside before locking
the door. I didn’t see Esteban and just assumed he was inside. Three hours
later, the doorman called to let me know that my cat was at my neighbors’.
Assuming he met the young escape artist, I reassured him that said cat was long
home. When I finally thought to look for Esteban, he was nowhere to be found. He
wasn't in the hallway either, but the door to 15C was propped open. In the
apartment, I found two very amused tenants who had been watching Esteban
thoroughly explore their apartment from floor to reachable tables, counters, and
shelves. Apparently, I overlooked him in my rush and he just meowed at doors
until somebody took him in.</p>

<p>Quite a bit weirder was what happened in the hallway one late evening in
2021. In fact, it was so weird, the story is best told in reverse, from its
ending. For that grand finale, Esteban was trotting down the hallway, loudly
battle-yodeling—imagine a feline take on <a rel=noreferrer

cry</a> from Hollywood Westerns or Leon Thomas’ inspired

yodeling</a> delivered in a rhythmic staccato—and chasing a family of four, who
were genuinely terrified of him, trying hard to make into their apartment before
he got there.</p>

<p>Moments before that unlikely chase, I had been sitting on the floor outside
my apartment, face mask on, reading and listening to music on my
noise-cancelling headphones. The cats were roaming about the hallway. When I
noticed some movement to my right, I was a bit slow to react because apartments
and passenger elevators are in the other direction and I hadn’t seen anyone head
down to the laundry room. When I did turn, I found the entire family by then
living in 15K, frozen midstep, staring at me with obvious alarm. Quite clearly,
they had taken the scenic route up, using the service elevator, to minimize the
likelihood of neighborly contact and had counted on no one being in the hallway
thanks to the late hour. They also were not receptive to my gestured invitation
to just keep walking by. I had to get up and go inside my apartment before they
would pass. When I noticed that Esteban, unlike David, hadn’t come back inside,
I stepped outside again and found the Great Chase well under way, with that
family fleeing from a house cat as if he was an apex predator ten times his
size.</p>

<p><em>Good boy!</em>—I didn’t say that. But I certainly thought it. And I can’t
claim that I was in any hurry to intervene.</p>

<p>As to Esteban, his battle-yodeling was reserved for situations when he was
worked up and going somewhere. That is consistent with him heading towards one
of his favorite haunts, 15K. It also is consistent with him chasing the parents
out of spite, for revenge. This is not the first time they have been unduly
paranoid about infectious diseases. And that first time, they took it out on
him. Right after moving in, they introduced themselves by complaining about the
cats’ presence in the hallway in general and Esteban’s attempts at entering
their apartment specifically. As justification, they uttered some nonsense about
her being pregnant and trying hard not to get infected with <i
lang=la>toxoplasmosis</i>.</p>

<p>Never mind that it is rather presumptuous—and mighty rude—to just treat my
cats as diseased. Also, only recent infections with <i lang=la>toxoplasmosis</i>
put a baby at risk and those won’t be found in indoor cats. Even free range cats
mostly pose an indirect danger. You’ll have to handle days-old poop and ingest
some of it as well to actually be at risk of infection. However, before you
claim that you’d never do that, consider whether you ever played in a sandbox.
No wonder that about a quarter of Americans are already infected with that
parasite. Still, I ignored their paranoid imposition and, to keep the neighborly
peace, mostly curtailed hallway time from then on out, much to Esteban’s dismay.
It took him months to give up on trying to leave with me every time I headed for
the door.</p>
</div>

<p>By the time of the Chase, I had relented in my enforcement somewhat for two
reasons: First, Prince David, King’s successor in the royal household and evil
genius, had taught himself how to open the rather heavy steel apartment door and
had been heading into the hallway more or less at will. It took Esteban a while
to notice what David had been up to. But once he did, Esteban reliably followed
in David’s wake. With both cats so clearly enjoying their hallway adventures and
Esteban immediately taking up his old routine of patrolling the entire length of
the corridor again, I didn’t want to deprive them of that experience.</p>

<p>Second, the family in 15K had taken to the covid pandemic by taking out their
paranoia on their neighbors again. Not only were they refusing to share the
elevator—no matter that everyone was masked—but they also made other people
wait. After being at the receiving end of this equally entitled and unhinged
behavior a couple of times, I couldn’t be bothered to take their needs into
account anymore. While I avoided hallway time during days and early evenings,
late evenings and night time were fair game. That’s just why I was sitting on
the floor outside my apartment while Esteban and David were roaming about in the
hallway that night.</p>

<p>In other words, Esteban not only had good reason to hold a grudge against the
parents, with them all turning up in the hallway, he also had the perfect
opportunity to turn their paranoia against themselves. Even if he didn’t intend
to, he played the situation beautifully. His battle-yodeling was a particularly
fine touch: As they were nervously fumbling with keys, he provided constant
reminder that he was getting closer and closer. He might have succeeded getting
into the apartment, but I reached him before that eventuality did occur and
brought him back to the area outside my door. He stayed there for a while. But
when the father walked past again on his way to the service elevator, Esteban
resumed his chase, this time in the other direction…</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p>As my gleeful tone makes ample clear, I much enjoyed the Great Chase, I enjoy
telling its tale, and I feel zero guilt or shame for that. It’s the best kind of
<i lang=de>Schadenfreude</i> because that family inflicted all the midmotion
freezing, the stressing and panicking, the frightful rushing from a household
cat to themselves. At the same time, they have all they need to cope differently
within easy reach. He earns his living as a psychiatrist. So he should have
knowledge and skills to develop a more reasoned and reasonable approach to
coping with disease. But instead they take it out on others. Having said that, I
do feel sorry for the children. With overprotective parents like that, their
pandemic experience must have been an even more claustrophobic hell than it was
for all of us.</p>

<p>The family has since moved to the suburbs. I hope that gives the children
opportunity and space for finding their own way, far from the clutches of those
parents. However, even though the tenants of 15K have changed, the cats
predicament hasn’t and they still can’t roam at will. In my first conversation
with the new tenants, a young straight couple, she impressed on me the severity
of her cat allergies. Ok. I heard her. We know the drill. I cut down on hallway
time and made sure there are no more breakouts during days and evenings. But
then two weeks later, when I see her and greet her, she responds with a cheerful
“Where are the cats?”—uhm what? So is she severely allergic or not? I’m getting
mixed signals here. But I also don’t care to find out more. We have kept our
distance since that interaction and I’ll be minimizing all contact until one of
us moves out.</p>

<p>Even weirder, I have encountered the opposite behavior as well. A guest with
an acknowledged cat allergy was developing obvious signs of resparatory
discomfort but insisted on staying put. I had to tell him “You have to leave.
<em>Now!</em>&thinsp;” I may have threatened him with calling an ambulance as
well. Why would anyone put themselves through that? I don’t even want to watch a
similar occurrence again. For that reason, I now stock allergy medication. It
made a difference once already. Still, I’m puzzled by people exaggerating or
trivializing their allergies. It serves no one, including themselves, and by
putting other people in distinctly uncomfortable or untenable situations such
behavior is bound to backfire.</p>

<section>
<h2>The Troubles</h2>

<p>I’ve gotten pretty far ahead of Esteban’s story. Let’s return, for now, to
the days when King Arthur was still heading the royal household. Just like the
relationship between me and my former partner, Esteban’s and King’s relationship
was truly great until it wasn’t anymore. The Troubles started one dark and
stormy night. I was busy with a friend in the other bedroom and heard them make
a racket for a short while. But that wasn’t that unusual and, as I said, I was
preoccupied. I still have no idea what set them off that night. The vet’s theory
is that King freaked out because of the thunderstorm and blamed Esteban for all
that thunder and lightning right outside the window.</p>

<p>Be that as may. Fact is that I found King in the bathroom in the morning,
trembling and peeing on himself (even though the litter box was barely a foot
away). He was that upset and only relaxed a bit after the vet gave him a valium
later on. From that day on, if Esteban came even remotely close to King, even
when each cat was in their own cage, King would flip out, growling and hissing
nonstop. As you can probably guess, Esteban wasn’t particularly impressed. But
he wasn’t particularly friendly either, getting ready to pounce instead.</p>

<p>With the Troubles thusly in their hot phase, I had little choice but to split
the apartment into two. Taking King’s far more fragile constitution into
account, my bedroom became King’s domain and the rest of the apartment
Esteban’s. I did make a point to spend as much time with Esteban as I could.
Still, he was heartbroken about being locked out from the bedroom and spent
hours howling outside the door. It was horrible. But there was little I could
do. I did try to find King a new home but no one was interested in adopting a
middle-aged cat with a taste for biological warfare. And so the cold phase of
the Troubles became routine.</p>

</figure>

<p>After many months of this, Esteban and King—thankfully—showed signs that
rapprochement might be possible. When I was a bit slow to close the bedroom door
again, they’d both come up, were sniffing each other, and were <em>ok</em> with
each other. After allowing for more of these short encounters and them behaving
similarly, I tried some closely supervised play sessions and, when they too went
well, increasingly left the door open—as long as I was home. Before long, I
relented even on that, starting with short trips to the store before leaving
them alone for hours. After maybe two years total, it seemed that the Troubles
were finally over again.</p>
</div>

<p>Well, kind of. King and Esteban never recovered the closeness they once
shared. And while they did share the bed with me at night again, I served a role
not unlike the Berlin Wall as a strict and rather arbitrary border. Esteban
slept on my left side and King slept on my right side. Neither would dare climb
over the wall at night, though King usually came to his resting place via the
territory of the class enemy. Since neither cat was averse to sitting on my
chest, said wall might function as joint security area as well. Frankly, the
wall enjoyed this dual purpose role.</p>

<p>Alas, my relief about the restoration of feline cohabitation soon gave way to
a depression that was so all-encompassing and deep, I came far too close to
ending myself. The primary trigger was medication I had been taking without
issues for many years, so neither my doctor nor myself were watching out for
signs of this known side effect, at least not anymore. By October 2017, I was so
far gone, I didn’t have the wherewithal to seek help despite knowing full well
how bad I was. All I could do is try to keep on going.</p>

<p>I held onto life thanks largely to the cats and Facebook (really!). The cats
were providing physical presence and constancy, whereas Facebook provided a
readily accessible forum for sharing my writing. And I was writing, writing
about anything and everything, writing like my life depended on it. That’s how I
discovered I could write. Alas, it was a nurse practitioner in my doctor’s
office who saved my life. We had previously bonded over a moment of somewhat
inappropriate bedside manner that left us both laughing long and hard. So during
a routine phone call, Abby picked up on me not being right, asked pointed
questions, and helped me make urgently needed changes that same day.
<em>Thank you, Abby!</em></p>
</div>

<p>Those changes, of course, included taking me off that medication. The impact
wasn’t immediate. My body took two days to flush most of the stuff out of my
system. Hence during the afternoon of the second day, in the course of just a
couple of hours, I could feel the depression lifting from me. It was as if an
all-encompassing, entirely black, heavy felt that had been dulling and dampening
all sensation was slowly but definitely dissolving. When it was done, by the end
of the afternoon, I wasn’t just feeling better, lighter, I was dancing on the
street. Really!</p>

<p>Despite the outcome, the experience of that drug losing its hold on my affect
was one of the more unsettling and traumatic experiences of my life. No thank
you! Worse is the knowledge that the pharmaceutical company making that drug
held back more effective and less toxic alternatives for years, so that it could
maximize its stranglehold on the <abbr>US</abbr> market for even longer.
Furthermore, it ruthlessly exploits that leverage by charging over three times
more than it does in other Western countries, notably Europe.</p>

<p>As I was slowly recovering over the next few months, King was rapidly
declining. By February 2018, any hope that he might recover again was vanishing,
just as his body was increasingly vanishing as well. After consulting with
friends on Facebook and listening to their stories about last days spent with
their old and sick cats and dogs, I made the heart-wrenching call to ease King’s
journey to the <i>Great Catnip Fields</i>. Sparing King a stressful trip out of
the house, the then owner of my vet practice agreed to come to my place on
Monday, February 19, 2018 a little after 6pm.</p>

<p>I wrote the previous paragraph on the subway, without referencing notes or
some such. Yet I don’t remember dates, at all. There’s only three I can tell you
off the top of my head: My own birthday (which would be hard to forget), my
sister’s birthday (which conveniently happened two years minus one week later),
and my closest friend’s birthday (which conveniently coincides with the United
States gaining independence, by day of year only). That King’s date of passing
now is the fourth tells you something about its impact.</p>

<p>Knowing that King harbors a deep love for string music, I spent the weekend
buying and setting up speakers for the bedroom and then making a playlist that
focuses on the revelatory and sacred:</p>

<li>A selection of my favorite pieces by Meredith Monk, mostly sung without

<li>Terry Riley’s <cite>One Earth, One People, One Love</cite> as an
encore.</li>
</ul>

<p>Out of these stand-out pieces, Björk’s performance is particularly dear to
me. It is both a faithful recreation of Meredith’s original and Björk’s own
unique interpretation. It also happens to be a recording of Björk’s only public
performance in 2005. Finally, if you listen carefully, you can clearly discern
yours truly’s delighted whoops amongst the applause afterwards. Admittedly, it
did help that I was sitting in first row center a mere 2m (6.5ft) from Björk. I
categorically deny the rumor that Carnegie Hall has a pristine, high fidelity
recording of all four hours of Making Music: Meredith Monk. Why would they
organize such an amazing event, record every minute of it with studio-quality
recording equipment, and then just keep those recordings to themselves?</p>

<p>King and Esteban loved it. They had forgotten all about the Troubles and
spent the day curled up next to each other, and me, on the same side of the bed.
Sure, each of us got up to eat or for a bathroom break once in a while. But just
like Making Music kept on going for four hours without interruption or break, we
kept on going, fully immersed in some of the most beautiful music wo·man ever
created for most of the day. The previous days had been rough for King, full of
discomfort and pain. He spent much of them under the bed and on the cool
bathroom counter. But Monday was different: King stayed with us all day and
cherished every minute of it. Shortly after the last sounds of Terry Riley's
encore had played, with all three of us still in a trance, Dr Farmer arrived.
King didn’t even get up and passed peacefully right there, on our bed.</p>

<h2 id=feline-behavior>Feline Behavior</h2>

<p>King’s death hit Esteban and me hard. We both were grieving for months. But
it also brought us even closer. Esteban would hardly part from my side
thereafter until the end of his life, regularly following me to the bathroom
even. When I was working at my desk, Esteban would join me, sleeping right next
to me—or at least be close-by, on our bed. For hours, he’d hold onto my left
hand, one paw holding on from below and one paw holding on from atop, with his
head resting on my hand. It didn’t bother him that I was moving my hand while
typing. And it didn’t bother my left wrist that there was noticeable weight
pushing down on it while typing. When we snuggled, it was mostly in bed. That’s
also where I noticed that I was developing distinctly feline behavior patterns,
turning my head away from him and nestling it between arms. He loved that and,
loudly purring, would insert his paws between my arms and join me in a close
snuggle.</p>

<p>When we humans face each other directly and distort our faces, eyes wide and
teeth baring, we usually call that a happy smile. When we also open our arms
wide, we consider that especially welcoming, a gesture usually reserved only for
our closest friends and family (and also comrades for those of us who haven’t
given up on wo·man deserving better than eternal, individualized struggle). It
also serves as overture to getting physically closer and wrapping our arms
around each other. Cats don’t work that way. Quite the opposite: Full frontal
faces with bared teeth are a sign of violent aggression. Now, the vast majority
of cats co-habitating with humans, Esteban amongst them, learn to live with us
behaving like we are all nuts, totally nuts. But that doesn’t mean they like it.
And in moments like these, I was meeting Esteban on his terms, one cat to
another, ready to snuggle. He loved it. Every single time.</p>

<p>That also explains that one time during a board meeting of the House
Foundation at my place, when Esteban strolled past the dozen or so people seated
around my living room table and jumped straight onto Meredith Monk’s lap—even
though she was the only person in the room severely allergic to cats and the
least welcoming. That is, to a human, her body language signaled apprehension,
possibly even dismay. To Esteban, she clearly was the least threatening and
probably the most excited to snuggle. So he jumped. Oops! By the time I got back
from picking up dinner for everyone, Meredith was gone, chased away by Esteban.
Thusly ended my time serving on that board. Nonetheless, Esteban can lay claim
to having sat on Meredith Monk’s lap, if only for a short moment. He was that
special!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my life was to become even more unsettled than it already was.
Leaving academia for industry four years before King’s death has been very much
double-edged as far as life-altering decisions go. I’ve learned a lot and
contributed to some really cool software systems. I’ve also experienced
astounding incompetence, often lurking behind cargo-cultish adherence to the <i
lang=la>status quo</i>, and far too much deeply problematic as well as clearly
unethical behavior. As far as the latter is concerned, my year working for
Facebook marks an astounding low. It’s not that I didn’t know I was walking into
a shitshow. <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180317131953/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html">News
about Cambridge Analytica</a> had broken just a couple of months before. But my
positive experience with the social network at one of the low points of my life
created considerable good will on my part and exploratory conversations with
people at the firm left an impression of genuine commitment to do better.
Notably, I came in hot to a conversation with a firm <abbr>VP</abbr> and it
still was very productive, even lasting double the alloted time.</p>
</div>

<p>Alas, as became obvious over my year of working there, Facebook is less a
corporation operating in a democracy than the contemporary successor to East
Germany’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi"><i lang=de>Stasi</i></a>
run for profit as a social impact cult. The cult part was obvious from the first
day. It triggered me into keeping my distance from the indigenous population and
devoting significant resources towards anthropological observation, which played
an important role in <a href="https://youtu.be/iYJQSfQGDEE">my invited talk</a>
about the firm at a major academic conference in 2020.</p>

<p>The violative parts weren’t quite so obvious. The New York Times helped bring
some of them to light during my employment and thereby hastened my exit a year
after signing on. Particularly galling was Sheryl Sandberg’s smear campaign of
Facebook-financed editorials against George Soros. When my observation that
Facebook bans users engaging in such inauthentic coordinated activity was read
but otherwise ignored by her team, I took to stating “I blame George Soros” in
discussions about things that had gone wrong at work.</p>

<p>Particularly devastating was Facebook’s enabling role in the genocide against
the Rohingya in Myanmar. Amazingly, the firm managed to repeat that feat two
years later, facilitating another genocide, this time in Ethiopia’s Tigray
region. Facebook’s role in both was entirely avoidable and a direct result of
the firm’s aggressive persuit of growth, with zero consideration given to actual
social impact. Real communities that still thrive on the social network cannot
compensate for the fact that Facebook is a blight on humanity and that all its
employees, particularly executives have blood on their hands. Its continued
existence points to an inhuman hollowness of capitalism <i lang=fr>à
l’américaine</i>. It also raises grave doubts about this country’s actual
commitment to human rights.</p>

<p>However, the primary reason that Facebook consumed much of my attention for
years <em>after</em> I quit working there was the serendipitous discovery of
compelling evidence that the firm was <a
href="/blog/2022/wrong-impression">defrauding customers, investors, and
regulators alike</a> by artificially inflating <em>the</em> most fundamental
advertising metric, ad impressions. Mind you, I had some fascinating
conversations with reporters at The New York Times, several partners of a tier-2
law firm specializing in regulatory enforcement (which happens to represent
Rupert Murdoch and Fox), and the Federal Trade Commission (<abbr>FTC</abbr>).
Yet those same conversations also were singularly frustrating. The bits that the
Times and law firm shared with me after due diligence were denials from
institutional advertisers that anything might be amiss; the <abbr>FTC</abbr>
didn’t even bother with that courtesy. All the same, I not only had the receipts
but also independent confirmation from another industry insider.</p>

<p>Working out that apparent contradiction took a while. I tell the full story
<a href="/blog/2022/wrong-impression">in another blog post</a>. It boils down to
institutional advertisers having their own data feeds that bypass significant
parts of Facebook’s advertising platform, something my manager had emphasized
again and again while I worked there. That limits the defrauded to individuals
and small businesses. Apparently, they lack the clout for making Times, law
firm, and <abbr>FTC</abbr> spring into action. As this episode vividly
illustrates, the trope of self-serving and corrupt elites so often invoked by
right-wing populists is firmly grounded in manifest reality. Alas, their
reaction to that observation, trying to blame migrants, Black and Brown people,
and the <abbr>LGBT</abbr> community, is utterly depraved and puts them firmly
into the “most likely to commit genocide” fringe of humanity. Yet despite their
shared primary interests, right-wing populists don’t seem to like Facebook. Go

<p>I had been so repulsed by Facebook’s total lack of ethics, I simply stopped
going to work. When after three weeks nobody had inquired about my whereabouts,
I ventured to the office one last time and handed in my resignation. I even came
up with a slogan cum logo for the occassion: “So long, and thanks for all the
gelato!” The gelato really was an exceptional perk. A dozen flavors freshly made
by artisans every day. A rotating selection every week. It was simply
spectacular. It also was the primary reason I didn’t quit earlier. I’m guessing
it made a three-month difference. Funnily enough, right after I handed in my
resignation, my adoption of Prince David was finally approved as well—despite
prior languishing in limbo for several weeks. I had first heard about the royal
maniac from my friend Stephanie after she gave him his first shots. His foster
mom had picked up on Esteban and me not being so happy during her home visit
and, realizing she had just the kitten to stir shit up, was super-supportive as
well.</p>

<p>Still, the adoption wouldn’t have gone through without the Landmarks
Preservation Commission. In a case of obvious clairvoyance, they had declared
the outside facade of my home one of those landmarkajigs in 1977, a perfect 42
years before that designation resolved an impasse about window screens, or the
lack thereof, during my adoption of Prince David. The crazy cat ladies holding
the monopoly on cat adoptions in the city wisely defer to that singular
commission as the one exception to their rules. But please don’t mock them for
it. Making an exception can’t be easy for people who are so unyielding in their
rule enforcement they make German government bureaucrats weep with joy at having
found their soulmates. In other words, as a German and cat lover, I get them.
Even when they occassionally make my life harder than need be.</p>

<p>With the renewal of the royal household thusly secured, I brought the
<em>royal maniac</em>—Esteban’s nickname for David—home with me the weekend of
<cite>Gay Pride 2019</cite>. Channeling his predecessor, he too immediately
vanished under the sofa and didn’t emerge again until the next day. Similarly,
he made the hallway closet one of his favorite hideouts. Several large,
bubble-wrapped frames form a padded ledge behind the coats. It had been King
Arthur’s favorite hideout and it is a favorite of Prince David’s too. Alas, to
fully claim the mantle of rulership, David still needs to join the royal
sleephold (<em>not</em> sleeper hold) and, so far, his attendance record has
been spotty. Alas, he seems to have belatedly realized that he is in clear
violation of the compact establishing the royal line and finally began making an
effort over the last couple of weeks—after years in the royal household and 1.5
months after Esteban’s death.</p>

<p>Esteban—if you remember the cat this remembrance is about when I am not
decrying Facebook’s duplicitous conduct and genocidal impact—had distinctly
ambivalent feelings about the royal renewal until that final day. Sure, it made
for a more lively household while also bringing opportunities for curling up
into or next to another feline. But Prince David is the feline equivalent of a
bro. He gets off on pointless displays of cattility, like racing the apartment
from one end to another, jumping up along door frames, or relentlessly pursuing
aging feline supermodels who have the great misfortune of living in the same
environs. In other words, David, like most bros, just doesn’t know when to
stop.</p>

<p>As told by Esteban, aging feline supermodel, the royal renewal has made the
journey from sleeping quarters in the royal sleephold to dining hall singularly
treacherous. The door of linens used to be nicely shut and serve as one of the
landmarks when crossing the canyon of closets. Nowadays, however, the door of
linen is open more often than not. Not only does this obstruct the journey, but
hidden inside may just lurk the royal maniac. So Esteban approaches gingerly and
peeks around the open door. On a good day, the royal maniac is busy elsewhere
and, once Esteban finished crossing the canyon of closets, it is an easy jaunt
to a nice, relaxed meal. On a bad day, the royal maniac is right there behind
the door of linens. That means Esteban’s meal plans are out of the window and he
better start running for dear life to his protector, the furless giant. On a
terrible day, the furless giant is nowhere to be found when one needs him most.
Moments later, one can feel the royal berserker landing on one’s back. Then his
teeth and claws sink in. Then… Esteban falters in his story and, after taking a
moment to collect himself, insists that he just doesn’t remember. And besides,
he’d rather talk about something completely different, such as the French
Revolution.</p>

<p>Since we are on the topic of doors: One evening a couple of months after the
royal renewal, David was watching me search through drawers in the main
bathroom. I noticed his curiosity and focus but didn’t think much of it. The
next day, after I returned from work, I found most drawers pulled open. From
that day on, David practiced his drawer opening skills every day. A few weeks
later, I observed David pull one drawer open, climb inside, pull the drawer
closed from inside, and after a dramatic pause emerge from another, different
drawer again. While he has grown too big to still crawl behind the drawers,
David continues to inspect their contents with some regularity. Since the larger
bottom brawer happens to have clothes in it, it continues to serve as the royal
trundle should David tire in its vicinity.</p>

<p>From drawers to cupboard doors, from cupboard doors to closet and room doors,
and from inside doors to the apartment door, David kept on practicing for months
and thereby kept on opening new levels of territorial reach. I was duly
impressed. But I also wasn’t so keen on the aftermath of David’s thorough
explorations. Thankfully, I can count some straight couples with children as
friends. Apparently, they face similar problems with their own, human spawn.
Proving that straight people can be clever too, they developed a deterrent,
something called “child safety lock.” Fascinatingly, they even have stores
dedicated to selling such gizmos. After a friend told me about all this, I
immediately bought several of these gizmos and can attest that they have been
100% effective at keeping David out of closets and the second bedroom. Except I
didn’t put locks on the coat and linen closets. David still uses them.
Surprisingly, these child safety locks also are rather effective at keeping
other gay men out of rooms.</p>

<p>Given his rapid progress, I should have expected that David would tackle the
apartment door as well. But that door is <em>obviously</em> different—beyond
being made from steel and hence quite a bit heavier than the others. It also
marks the boundary between mine and not so much mine. King intuitively
understood and respected that difference. Esteban and David not so much. If they
can get there, it’s theirs. It’s almost as if they have rejected individual
ownership of property.</p>

<p>Given that this take on ownership is rather common amongst the feline set, I
find it puzzling that so many Americans will cohabitate with cats. Usually,
Americans of all political persuasions are prone to hysterical fits, even
violent seizures, at the mere mention of “socialism.” It reliably is a
spectacle. And it quickly becomes tiring. Yet when it comes to cats, those same
people suddenly have no qualms covering room and board for avowed socialists.
Without any histrionics. Without seizures. Having grown up in Europe, I do not
suffer from this most peculiar malady. In fact, living in the United States made
me realize the inherent goodness of the cause. Still, I have to balance my
revolutionary designs with good neighborly relations. Hence, just like King, I
subscribe to the distinction between inside the apartment and outside the
apartment—or, my apartment and the people’s hallway. Unfortunately for Esteban
and David, I also impose that view onto my cat mates.</p>

<p>That probably explains why David waited until I was travelling to Germany in
early February 2020 before staging his first apartment break. Once he realized I
wasn’t coming back for the night, he probably started working the door until he
worked it open. My catsitter texted me in the morning about finding both cats in
the hallway, with the door wide open. Despite being pretty darn certain that I
pulled the door closed, I convinced myself that I must have forgotten to do just
that in my rush to get to the airport. David disabused me of that notion shortly
after my return when he proudly gave a paw-on demonstration of his latest skill.
By now, opening the front door has become so routine, it takes him a few seconds
at most.</p>

<p>Alas, if you think about it, only a little, that’s not where the story ends.
It simply can’t. And it didn’t. After all, there clearly is one more door to
unlock, at least while remaining on the 15<sup>th</sup> floor: Our neighbors’
doors! Huh? One more door is neighbor’s doors, plural? How does that work? I’d
say that from a knowledge and skills perspective, there really is only one more
door on the floor. The one that leads from not so much mine to truly theirs.
Amazingly, Prince David realized that transference of knowledge himself, without
prompting or help from anyone including me. Unfortunately, he picked the worst
possible time for his first and, so far, only attempt.</p>

<p>The pandemic hit New York City right after my return and it hard,
devastatingly hard. For the months of March and April 2020, the city became the
global epicenter for covid. It brought the city that never sleeps<sup>u</sup>
came to a near total standstill, with anyone who could cooped up at home and
opening their door only well after the hapless delivery person had left again. I
live at one of the busier intersections in Brooklyn, next to a commuter rail
station, and above a subway station where ten different lines meet. There always
is <em>some</em> noise outside. Day or night. Not so during those two
months.</p>
</div>

<p>The city had fallen silent, completely, oppressively silent. The only
noticeable sounds were the daily banging of pots and pans to honor first
responders and medical personnel—and the wailing of ambulances when yet another
wretched soul was rushed off to a hospital with uncertain prospects of survival.
In early March, the wailing happened sporadically and mostly during daytime. By
end of April, it still happened intermittently but all the time, day and night.
Over those two months, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_York_City">covid
killed over 15,000 New Yorkers</a>. By comparison, it would take another twenty
months for covid to kill the next 15,000 residents. No wonder then that
refrigerated trucks to hold the bodies of the recently deceased were standing
outside every single healthcare facility.</p>

<p>I spent my days obsessing over the latest news about covid and my nights
communing with the ghosts of friends who died from <abbr>AIDS</abbr> some
decades ago. That way, my first and second pandemic increasingly became one and
the same, a continuum of deadly viral infections. I would have lost all sense of
time if it wasn’t for the daily banging of pots and pans. It startled me,
surprised me more than once. How can it be 24 hours later? Really? Yup, they are
banging on metal again. Another day. And so, the daily banging of pots and pans
became a rather coarse clock for me and also served as helpful tether to the
space time continuum. Or manifest reality as I usually call it.</p>

<figcaption>Times Square apocalypse</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To emphasize the deep disruption of those days in New York City, consider
this: One late Friday evening in April, I decided to reconnect with the space
part of the continuum and went on walk-about through Manhattan. Over three
hours, I leisurely trekked from the <abbr>AIDS</abbr> memorial in Greenwich
Village along 7<sup>th</sup> Avenue past Madison Square Garden and through Times
Square, then continuing along Broadway up to 58<sup>th</sup> Street. The
apocalypse had finally, actually happened and the city that never sleeps had
ceased to exist. I wouldn’t have been surprised had I run into Snake Plissken.
New New York felt closer to the fictional version from <cite>Escape from New
York</cite> than the real deal did before the pandemic. At the same time, I
didn’t really need Snake. I never felt unsafe—despite encountering at most 30
humans total on the street that night.</p>

<p>The funny part: I cannot stand non-pandemic Times Square with its seemingly
permanent siege by tourons. It is the one area in New York City I generally try
to avoid. But I really enjoyed the post-apocalyptic, pandemic Times Square so
utterly devoid of people. There is something to the spectacle of all those
hyper-aggressive, high-tech billboards trying so very hard to razzle-dazzle,
ahem, no one. I find the contrast between intensely exuberant performance and
devastating absence not only fascinating but see real beauty in this spectacular
void.</p>
</div>

<p>For icing, oh so delicious icing, I didn’t have to battle row upon row of
tourons, dressed in their outlet-mall-finest and marching in lockstep six or
eight across. Instead I could just stroll across the square as I saw fit. Even
better, I paid no heed to what, in non-pandemic times, is designated for
pedestrian or automobile use, walking in the middle of the avenue more often
than not. Like people, like cars, the streets saw hardly any traffic that night.
The few automobiles that were about were going at speeds more suitable to a
suburban cul-de-sac full of children than Manhattan, which left plenty of
time to step out of the way.</p>

<p>Around the same time of night a couple days before or after my walk-about,
remember that time was elastic during that time, I was sitting on the floor
outside my apartment, face mask on, reading and listening to music on my
headphones. The cats were roaming about in the hallway and, last time I checked,
had made it to the opposite end, just before the bend to the elevators. When I
noticed some unusual movement to my far left and turned my head, I saw Prince
David performing pull-ups on 15H’s doorhandle—which is just what he does when
opening a door. At 2am in the morning. During the first months of a deadly
pandemic. While <abbr>NYC</abbr> was its global epicenter.</p>

<p>My heart skipped a beat. In my mind, I was picturing my arrest about half an
hour later, with the officers openly ridiculing me for maintaining that I didn’t
do it but my cat did. I was also running down the hallway faster than I thought
possible. When I got to the door—oh my god—I was mightily relieved to find it
closed. Esteban really picked the perfect nickname when he started calling David
“the royal maniac.”</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p>I feel compelled to add a disclaimer here: Yes, the pandemic was deeply
traumatic for me. That has a lot to do with the fact that I was dealing with two
simultaneous pandemics instead of one. That’s a bit much. At the same time, I am
very clearly one of the privileged. While I was jobless at the time, I had a
nice, large apartment at my disposal and sufficient funds to pay for food,
clothing, and so on. Because I could isolate from others and consistently wore
face masks, I didn’t get covid until 2.5 years into the pandemic and didn’t
require mechanized help to keep breathing. I wasn’t homeless, roughing it on
streets that were quite a bit more frightening because generally deserted. I
didn’t have to queue at food pantries or otherwise go starving. My basic needs
were covered. For far too many, they were not. That this happened in one of the
richest countries on Earth just shows how deeply rotten this country really
is.</p>

<p>Likewise, I feel compelled to express my frustration here: The disregard so
many people showed for other people’s health was simply infuriating. Between the
devastating possible outcomes, not “only” death but also long covid, and some of
us being immunocompromised, the pandemic was hell enough. But instead of
supporting each other, many chose to make the pandemic an even worse hell.
Consistently wearing a face mask is no great imposition. Insisting on the
freedom not to wear one is an astounding display of egotism. After all, that
also is the freedom to infect others with a deadly virus.</p>

<p>I got so frustrated I publicly shamed a neighbor from another floor on
Twitter. Of course, he wasn’t happy when he discovered his mug with my choice
caption. So I endured his tirade when he found me outside smoking without much
push back. But when he retaliated with homophobic and transphobic comments every
time he saw me, he only confirmed that he deserved to be called out.</p>

<p>A friend observed that if we gays had taken to safer sex during the dark days
of <abbr>AIDS</abbr> like straight people took to face masks during covid, we’d
all have been rounded up in concentration camps. I used to concur but the
on-going open season against drag queens and trans folk in states such as
Florida shows that it doesn’t even require widespread violation of public health
guidance during a plague. Apparently, our very existence is so threatening it
justifies the withholding of health care. That approach has the additional
benefit of avoiding the bad press associated with camps while also making the
resulting deaths much less conspicuous.</p>

<p>It was a grave mistake to allow marriage equality to lull us into complacency
and assimilation. It also was a grave mistake to hitch our political interests
on a single political party, which just takes our support for granted. Case in
point is the Biden administration’s slow and bumbling response when we gays were
facing pandemic #3, mpox, during the spring and summer of 2022. Since the same
vaccine covers smallpox and mpox, the United States has been sitting on many
millions of doses of an effective and safe vaccine in its strategic reserve.</p>

<p>But those doses hadn’t been filled into vials and packaged for distribution.
Instead they were sitting in large batches in the manufacturer’s freezers in
Denmark. The responsible agency, the Federal Drug Administration, ignored mpox
for several months, then insisted on an unnecessary inspection but also did
nothing towards that inspection for several more months. Further compounding the
crisis was that the trickle of vaccine that made it to the <abbr>US</abbr>
wasn’t distributed according to need, making a bad situation in the most
severely impacted city, New York, even worse.</p>

<p>Against that background, it is not surprising that I couldn’t get a vaccine
appointment despite trying hard for over a month. One week, I was lucky enough
to get a slot but then lost it again when the system errored out during the
confirmation process. So frustrating! I had started looking into getting
vaccinated in Germany when a tranche became available while I was on Twitter and
I saw the tweet right after it was posted. Alas, the supply issues got only
worse over the summer. As a result, I got my second shot four instead of three
months after the first and only as a reduced dose. Meanwhile a friend who hadn’t
been as lucky in lining up appointments got infected. He was utterly miserable
for two weeks, though did not have any complications. Thankfully! My one
consolation in all this is, should Russia or Iran or North Korea or Da’esh
attack the country with smallpox, we gays will shrug our shoulders and keep on
partying.</p>

<p>As Esteban got older, the tireless kitten gave way to an incredibly social
cat, who eventually gave way to an aging supermodel who needed his beauty sleep,
lots of beauty sleep. For the most part, that is just the normal cycle of
seasons in mammal life. At the same time, the pandemic certainly didn’t help and
probably only heightened this turning back to the basics. Still, basics isn’t
exactly a precise term and Esteban’s basics might just as well count as
eccentricities for most house cats.</p>

<p>Let’s start with food stuffs, particularly plants. A few days after Esteban’s
passing, my neighbors in 15G made the sweetest gesture by leaving a bouquet of
flowers outside my door. It still is one of only a handful of times that I
genuinely smiled. Since I discovered it when heading out to meet a friend, I
left the flowers right there. See, if Esteban had still been alive, the vase
would be close to empty upon my return and the flowers would be half eaten and
half spread around kitchen and living room. When he still was a kitten, I built
elaborate mesh wire contraptions to protect potted plants. But Esteban reliably
eventually went for the kill, even for spiky cacti.</p>
</div>

<p>Or for ficus trees. Over several years, I had nursed a rather forlorn looking
ficus bushling into a beautiful tree larger than even me. I’m not sure why, but
the tree was positively thriving under my <i lang=fr>laissez-faire</i> approach
to plant care. Esteban sampled maybe a leaf once in a while, but largely left it
alone. It probably helped that fici are indigestible for cats and that he
reliably threw up those samples again. But then one day Esteban apparently went
“what the heck!” and started eating—and throwing up—from the tree every single
day. After noticing that Esteban was somewhat dehydrated, the vet recommended
getting rid of the tree. So I did. My apartment has been barren ever
since—except for the occasional catnip. But that was a knowing sacrifice to the
great destroyer of plants.</p>

<p>After I got home again, I brought the flowers in with me, set them up on the
kitchen counter, and waited a while. But unlike Esteban, David didn’t come
running to go postal on those flowers and, besides pulling out one or two small
ones, left them alone over the following days as well. So they brightened up my
kitchen and life for well over a week. Thank you, Jan and Richard!</p>

<p>Esteban himself reminded me of another, stranger taste during the last week
of his life. Karin had come one morning to say her goodbyes and all three of us
had sat down on the floor in the kitchen area. Over the course of the
conversation, our attention shifted away from him and he left us to it. When I
noticed him coming back and grooming his face, I was puzzled. I had fed him
fairly recently and he had eaten all of his special cat treats, which were the
only food he’d still eat. Then I remembered: I was in the middle of breakfast
when Karin arrived and had just prepared a slice of bread with a generous spread
of butter and lots of honey. Alas, the butter and honey were no more. Esteban
had licked the bread clean!</p>

<p>I had known that Esteban had a pronounced sweet tooth ever since I caught him
licking granulated sugar straight out of the sugar bowl. But I haven’t enabled
it since noticing. Or that’s what I thought when I first started drafting this
section. Then it dawned on me that the one food ritual the two of us shared also
indulged his sweettooth, even if it was only a little. There is only one of
those rituals because, out of principle, I don’t share human food with cats. As
it turns out, laziness sufficed for starting this one.</p>

<p>I have the occasional bowl of cereal while busy working and tend to let the
emptied bowl sit on my desk before bringing it back to the kitchen. Since
Esteban spent significant time right next to me on the desk, he soon discovered
that what I call an empty bowl contains enough milk sweetened by cereal to make
it worth his licks. He loved it. In fact, he loved it so much that when he’d
hear me pour cereal in the kitchen, he came running so that he could follow me
whereever I’d sit down. He then positioned himself right next to me and
impatiently waited for his turn. When I was getting close to the bottom—or was
taking too long—he’d start pawing for the bowl. And when it finally became his
turn, he’d greedily lap up whatever remained.</p>

<p>Whereas Esteban’s eating habits reflected a genuine love of food, Esteban’s
puking habbits were altogether different. First, several seconds before he’d
barf, Esteban would loudly announce that we was about to retch. He even had a
dedicated and attention-grabbing sound for the occasion, somewhere between a
<a rel=noreferrer href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHCmzvzCmhI">foghorn</a>
and Cher intoning ”<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZXRV4MezEw&t=59">be-lie-ie-ie-ve</a>” in
her eponymous song. After thusly sounding the alarm, he’d try to make it to the
runner in the entrance area. Finally, he’d throw up onto that runner. Amazingly,
he managed to further dial up the bizare factor over the last few months of his
life. The first time he did so, I had heard his clarion call from the kitchen,
but was stuck at my desk in a video conference. When I finally could go looking,
I couldn’t find what he had brought up. That is, until I noticed that one of the
food bowls was full again without my doing anything…</p>

<hr>

<p>When I started thinking about this section, I wasn’t sure whether the above
was simply too much information, or at least too mundane or trivial to really be
of interest. My grief overrode those doubts: With my memories of Esteban all
that I have left, even his daily habits and ticks have taken on outsized
meaning. Not including them here felt like a betrayal.</p>

<p>Now that I have written the section, I am glad I pressed on because it helped
me make two loosely related realizations. The first is tht the impact of the
pandemic very much lingers, with my life still being focused inwards and
domesticity still playing a far larger role than it used to be. I suspect I am
not the only one to have retreated like that from the larger world. That is not
to say that I am not paying attention to what’s going on outside. I do. But I do
experience the outside world as far more alien and alienating than ever before.
I strongly suspect that I am not the only one in that position. I am also not
sure whether I am ready to change any of that. Between mpox, a friend just
having been hospitalized with covid, and climate change running amok, the
outside world hardly seems safe.</p>

<p>The second realization is that many of my own mundane habits and household
rules are a response to the cats, particularly Esteban. The most important ones
include:</p>

<ul class=tight>
<li>Don’t leave a glass with water or cocktail unattended.</li>
<li>Don’t leave anything edible unattended.</li>
<li>Rinse food remains off dishes right away.</li>
<li>Always close the lid after using the toilet.</li>
<li>Check toilet after guests have used it.</li>
<li>Never open windows more than a small crack.</li>
<li>Immediately throw away rubber bands.</li>
<li>Immediately throw away ribbons from gifts</li>
</ul>

<p>The one time I was a bit slow to throw away a ribbon, Esteban had already
ingested some of it. Pulling that out of his mouth again was not something
either of us enjoyed. But that wasn’t the end of it. Ribbons can be deadly to
cats because they easily cause a stomach obstructions. Hence I had to closely
monitor Esteban and his poop. Two days later, I was rewarded for my vigilance
with a poop pellet that—thanks to the ribbon sneaking out at one end—would have
made the perfect Christmas tree ornament. Alas, that would have been a clear
violation of the next two rules:</p>

<ul class=tight>
<li>No Christmas tree ornaments: They will just be thrown around.</li>
<li>No Christmas tree: It will just be thrown around.</li>
<li>Re-engage child safety lock after opening the closet.</li>
<li>Keep the front door double-bolted.</li>
<li>Make sure the mattress is always covered by a spill cover.</li>
<li>Always lock keyboard and comforter into closet before trips.</li>
</ul>

<p>Admittedly, I have gotten less stringent about the latter two since King’s
passing. He simply couldn’t approve of me travelling. It went against everything
he believed in. So when I did travel nonetheless, he had to make himself heard.
At first, he tried puking all over my rather expensive <a
href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">ergonomic keyboard</a>. Then he
decided that being pissed meant pissing, typically on our bed. As far as
retributive acts are concerned, they were a mixed affair. Some of it was
surprisingly effective at getting back at me, largely due to the replacement
costs for keyboard and mattress. At the same time, it was all too obvious and
crude—and hence not up to King’s usual, rarefied standards.</p>

<p>King did eventually develop a way of expressing himself that reflected real
artistry. Unfortunately he did so only a couple of months before his death and
so one single performance remains King’s only contribution to contemporary art.
I had been on a 24 hour sojourn to the Jersey shore, keeping my trip short out
of concern for an ailing King. When I arrived back home, everything was fine. I
said hello to the cats, dropped my duffel bag in the bedroom, and headed out
again to buy cat food. Upon my return, I found the duffel bag, still zipped
closed where I left it with a puddle of cat piss on top. Yet there was not a
single drop of spillage on the floor. It was an astounding achievement,
referencing Marina Abramović’s oeuvre as well as Andres Serrano’s <cite>Piss
Christ</cite> but far better, an intensely personal piece that was utterly
fascinating yet also deeply revolting, and ultimately absolutely baffling.
Simply wow!</p>

<section aria-labelledby=compañero>
<h2 id=compañero>Friend, Compañero</h2>

<p>It all started 19 years ago when I made a leap of faith, picked Esteban, and
gave him the time and space to pick me too. I started this remembrance by
claiming that, from his perspective, I became his bitch that day. That word
seemed safest without unduly anthropomorphizing the cat. Alas, in addition to
being suffocatingly heteronormative, it too is way off because—ignoring that
one, short time he licked my right nipple while my then partner licked my left
one—our relationship never was sexual.</p>

<p>The often made claim that we humans only are servants to our cats doesn’t
help much either. In fact, it is the worst kind of observation, one that
purports to be clever when in manifest reality it is pure misdirection: What
opportunities for self-sufficient life present themselves to an indoor cat
living on the, say, 27<sup>th</sup> or 15<sup>th</sup> floor of a
<abbr>NYC</abbr> apartment building? We take care of our pets because we put
them in an environment where they are entirely dependent on us. In fact, the
same argument can be made about toddlers, but we don’t usually accuse them of
abusing us as indentured servants. Maybe that’s because the vast majority of
toddlers grow beyond the cognitive acumen of a three-year-old and have opposable
thumbs all along. Be that as may, cats most definitely do not.</p>

<p>The point: Even under analytical scrutiny, despite all the obvious
differences and inequalities, I cannot but see something mutual that allowed
both me and Esteban to experience sincere companionship. It may have lacked the
intellectual or carnal pleasures always present as a potential between humans.
But likewise, it also came without all the added complications of most human
relationships. That’s precious as far as companionship goes and even amongst
humans limited to a very few, very close friends.</p>

<p>The differences and inequalities turn the companionship into a heavy burden
when Esteban gets sick. How to do right by him when he won’t talk, when there is
no consent, informed or otherwise, when watching him for clues is akin to
reading tea leaves because there is so little difference between “it’s bad but I
can manage” and “I just can’t go on anymore.” Worse, negotiating all that
doesn’t get any easier with repetition. On the contrary, it only gets worse. And
I had been through all this with King already.</p>

<p>I got my first taste of what was to come about two years ago. Esteban had
been diagnosed with early kidney disease some months before. That would have
been manageable if he would eat the special renal diet. But he never warmed up
to it. I tried every single flavor of every single brand I could get my hands
on. He maybe picket at it. But he never at it all, prefering to go hungry
instead. Not surprisingly, he was losing weight and he did so at borderline
dangerous rate. After yet another vet visit charting that precipitous decline, I
gave up on trying to manage his kidney disease and gave up on countering his
strongly held conviction that renal diet was inedible. If he’s gonna go, I’d
rather have him enjoy his final year—because if that decline had continued, he
wouldn’t have made it through the year.</p>

<p>He did make it. And he did enjoy it. When I announced to the vet a year later
that we simply did the opposite of what they recommended, she was taken aback at
first. But after checking him out, she also agreed that he had stabilized. The
blood work confirmed that his kidney disease hadn’t progressed much either. It
also added another diagnosis to worry about: Hyperthyrodism. Properly medicated,
that disease too is manageable. But again, manageability was hard to come by.
The pills made Esteban throw up every few days, which isn’t particularly helpful
to a cat who is already too thin. So we switched to a creme to be rubbed into
his ears. Now the vet’s unrealistic instructions interfered with my unsteady
sleeping schedule and we took a while to find rhythm that worked for me and
him.</p>

<p>We had just gotten the hang of it, when during his last vet visit, she
noticed a lump in his cheek. I immediately knew what that implied.




<p>Making the call to ease Esteban’s suffering was even harder than for King. I
had already made an appointment with one vet and cancelled it again. I tried a
second time and couldn’t follow through. But over that week, Esteban also got
worse. He slept only once with me in bed. So I found another vet who makes house
visits and made the appointment. For my birthday. At 2pm. Esteban and I spent
the time around noon listening to Benjamin Britten’s War Requiem. He was so
miserable, I had to lift him up onto bed. But once there, he curled up into me
and lasted until the <i lang=la>Libera Me</i> That cut too close. Then Cordula
came, the doctor arrived, Ako came, and

</p>

<hr>

<p>In another week, it will have been two months since Esteban’s death. I also
will have finished and published this remembrance. When I first started writing,
the words just kept on coming. I was worried about too much material. But then,
when I was getting to the latter sections, I found myself in the opposite
predicament. Progress slowed to a crawl and even that took considerable
discipline and willpower. In particular, I struggled finding a balance between
this piece’s inherent focus on Esteban and the various intrusions (Facebook,
pandemic, startup jobs, …) that have been accumulating of late. Since those
intrusions impacted all of us, I believe they fundamentally belong here too. At
the same time, I did cut down on some of the material, many of the drafts I made
for the last several sections included more material on intrusions that I culled
again before the final version.</p>

<p>Much harder to cope with is the immense grief I still feel. Especially when
working on this remembrance, some small detail will set me off eventually and I
start sobbing. Since I tend to write on subway trips, that unfortunately means
that I may just start sobbing on the subway. I managed to keep to silent tears
only a few times. But I also did sob a couple of times. Other straphangers will

that unfortunately combinesI may just start sobbing
</p>

<p>The last few weeks of his life were strange. As the cancer in his cheek grew
so large it deformed his face, Esteban couldn’t fully close his mouth anymore
and started drooling a lot all the time. I was mostly surprised by my own
reaction, which was to matter-of-factly wipe his mouth when necessary and
otherwise be nonplused. Esteban was super skinny by now and probably starving
all the time. When I started feeding him treats, he nonetheless decided that
only treats will do from then on and rejected all cat food besides the filets
and the churos. That certainly was his prerogative. I had to

<p>It’s been over a month since Esteban’s passing. I still start sobbing at the
most opportune and inopportune times. Working on this remembrance took
everything out of me at times and more often than not left me in tears. Whether
on the street, smoking and taking notes, or on the subway, writing furiously on
my phone, I may end up crying—or sobbing even. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’m
not sure New Yorkers know what to do when faced with a grown man in tears. Alas,
with climate change turning our only habitat into Hell on Earth and us still
sitting idly by, with this month on track to become the hottest month on record,
easily beating last month from its record-setting place, such <em>public
displays of despair</em> will only get more frequent and it’s only a question of
time until you will join me, too. My advise: Don’t hold back, show your anger,
show your grief. Business as usual will get you nowhere.</p>

<p>I am heartbroken. I miss Esteban so much. You were one special fella and the
best companion I could ask for for almost two decades. I am so sorry that the
last few months of your life were so hard, that nothing could satiate the hunger
you were clearly feeling, that pain became a constant. I did what I could and I
hope you forgive me for easing your passing to the <i>Great Catnip Fields</i>.
Thank you! Really: <em>Thank you!</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Throughout the pandemic, our late night escapades into the outside hallway
provided plenty of opportunity for Esteban to make his routine round all the way
down the hallway and around the corner to the passenger elevators as well as
back again. He got to check for new and unusual smells and to just hang out. But
that couldn’t quite make up for the hallway experience of yore. While Esteban
certainly enjoyed this reduced experience, the most important part,
opportunities for social interaction, was missing. Obviously, they weren’t
forthcoming during those days. In fact, as the Great Chase demonstrated,
neighbors might positively recoil from his advances and flee from him in
terror.</p>

<p>After I had found a new position and started spending significant time in
video conference calls, Esteban quickly wisened up to that fact. Soon enough,
when I went on a call, he’d come over from bed, positioned himself between me
and camera, and—like Evita on her balcony—wallowed in the attention of his
adoring public. While I have doubts about the depth of my co-workers’
appreciation for his presence, it was enough for him. I’m very glad he did it
too because him sitting still like that provided me with many an opportunity for
taking selfies of the two of us. I’m sure you have already admired them
throughout this remembrance. It’s amazing how many of them turned out to be just
great. I’m so very glad I got to spend those moments with him. While being
unemployed, again, is a cause of considerable anxiety, that also gave me the
time and freedom to be there with him at the end and to write this remembrance.
I’m so very glad for both. And with that, we have reached the end.</p>
