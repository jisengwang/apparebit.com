<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<div class=heading><h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2></div>

<p class=capped><span>Several decades ago</span>, when I was a mere teenager in
Würzburg, Germany, some mad visionary decided to open a record store focusing on
music that, at the time, still had the whiff of being avant-garde or even
experimental but really is the contemporary branch of classical music. At the
time, Würzburg was a blessedly small city with only 126,000 inhabitants. Of
course, that also meant that Würzburg was a cursedly small city, hence me now
living in a city of barely acceptable size. Either way, given Würzburg’s size,
it was all too predictable that I would find myself standing in said store
within days of its opening. Now “store” is too grand a word for what really was
the large living room of a ground-floor apartment, reachable through a long
hallway from the entrance of a residential building and converted to a record
store with custom press wood shelving best described as barely functional.</p>

<p>Sadly, I have no mental image of the proprietor, whose labor of love forever
opened my ears to sounds that I can’t fathom living without. It is thanks to him
that I discovered many of my favorite composers of contemporary classical music.
The one dearest to both my heart and soul is Meredith Monk. It was <cite>Dolmen
Music</cite> that opened the door to an entirely different world of music, soon
thereafter joined by <cite>Turtle Dreams</cite>, also acquired from said store.
Meredith’s music is unique and special because it comes from that most essential
and most human of instruments, the voice. But it dispenses, for the most part,
with human language, which at its most benign can get in the way of just being,
of experiencing.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=other-worlds-revealed>
<div class=heading>
<h2 id=other-worlds-revealed class=belyssimo>Other Worlds Revealed</h2>
</div>

<p class=capped><span>Meredith’s gift</span> to this world is music that sings,
wails, chirps, growls, purrs, clicks, and, most importantly, always breathes. It
is music about the fleeting moments of the everyday and the mysteries of the
sacred alike. It largely ignores the classical arrangements of classical
orchestras and instead is so sparse in non-vocal instrumentation as well as
complex melodic expression that one might call it “minimalist”. But it also
reminds of folk music, which—just like Meredith’s compositions—are part of a
more oral, community-based, nurturing, and often female tradition. Over the
years, I have encountered many a music critic who describes Meredith’s work as
somewhat comparable to or reminiscent of Gregorian Chant. That comparison seems
like a disservice to me because it zooms in on one aspect of her music, a
sometime sparse aesthetic of mysterious remoteness, but neglects so many other
aspects of what she calls <dfn>extended vocal technique</dfn> that are equally
important. It also has the faint malodor of sexism, since Gregorian Chant often
was an all male affair. Meredith’s work obviously is not and, in fact, her most
recent work, <cite>Cellular Songs</cite>, derives its amazing power in part from
being an all female performance.</p>

<p>To better understand the limits of that comparison, let’s consider
<cite>Astronaut Anthem</cite> from Meredith’s 1987 album <cite>Do You Be</cite>,
not coincidentally also the title of this appraisal. The song starts with an
undistinguished, low grade murmur by Meredith and her ensemble accompanied by
the piano’s exceedingly slow four chord repetition. Out of that grumble then
emerges a celebratory chorus that indeed is reminiscent of Gregorian Chant and
similarly heavy on male voices. As the song progresses, the chorus grows in
intensity and slowly reaches upwards. The melody also becomes more complex with
different singers providing point and counterpoint. But just before the chorus
reaches its presumptive climax, out of nowhere, the women join, sharp vocal
glissandi rising to higher registers, blaring a dissonant alarm that envelops
and then subdues the refined chant and thereby grinds the song to a halt. Any
listener at the time of the album’s release would immediately recall the images
going around the world just a year prior: On <time datetime=1986-01-28>28
January 1986</time>, the space shuttle Challenger broke apart <time
datetime=PT73S>73 seconds</time> into flight, killing all seven astronauts and
showering earth with pieces of debris.</p>

<p>Quite clearly, <cite>Astronaut Anthem</cite> draws on Gregorian Chant to
commemorate and celebrate the deceased. Yet it also makes the horror of an
exploding spacecraft viscerally audible through human voices calling out in
severe distress, a moment that still makes me cry over 30 years later. But it
doesn’t stop there. The sum of the song distinctly is greater than its parts.
The song serves as celebration of human ingenuity, in awe of us literally
reaching for the sky. Yet the song also is warning that any flight of human
fancy must necessarily end back here on earth. The question then is whether we
can meet our maker with integrity and, ideally, love. If you think that’s
putting too much into <time datetime=PT4M56S>4 minutes and 56 seconds</time> of
music or that the sentiment is somewhat trite, that’s fair. But I would also
counter that the song is delivered with deep sincerity and honesty. The emotions
and thoughts I just described are right there for you to hear as well. The
lesson, while familiar to all of us, is so very challenging, since it requires
tending and nurturing at all times. The ultimate wonder of <cite>Astronaut
Anthem</cite>, beyond being a beautiful and touching song, is that it helps
center the listener and thus prepare her to do just that tending and nurturing.
It even gave my ailing aging cat King Arthur a final moment of peace just before
passing. So, I encourage you to trust Meredith and let her guide you on a
journey unlike few in this world.</p>

<p>At this point, two disclaimers are in order. This is very much a personal
appraisal for those same disclaimers. First, since childhood, music has been an
essential force in my life. It nurtures, comforts, celebrates, distracts,
energizes, and heals. But I have no ability to compose music myself. I did play
the piano, for some definition of play, from mid-oughts well into my teenage
years. Towards the end of my piano playing days, I was competent enough to play
Bach and Bartok, which seemed the perfect high note to stop. It also seems
apropos of me straddling a very classic education with years of Latin and
Ancient Greek vis-à-vis a sincere appreciation of modernity as well as a deep
rooting in the oral folk history of my own family. In simpler words, I have
basic music literacy, but I certainly do not command the vocabulary or insight
of a music critic, let alone a serious performer or composer. I am writing from
the perspective of a well-informed fan, in the best sense of the word: somebody
who is fanatic about something that matters.</p>

<p>Second, my personal perspective of Meredith’s work is necessarily lopsided
because all early exposure was through recordings. I would argue that music is
indeed the center of Meredith’s universe. But her art goes hand in hand with
human gesture and motion. More fundamentally, Meredith’s work is inherently
performative. It certainly also is a form of dance. It probably is for those
very reasons that I cannot sit still during her performances. My body just needs
to move with her music, even if I don’t know exactly how to. But those aspects
were missing from my first forays into her work and it is only through the last
16 years of living in New York City that I was able to fill in some of those
blanks. In some ways, my incomplete early experience of Meredith’s work mirrors
the challenges posed by a practice of art that is closer to an oral tradition
and thus so very brittle and possibly fleeting.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=a-new-tradition>
<div class=heading>
<h2 id=a-new-tradition class=belyssimo>A New, Urban Tribe</h2>
</div>

<p class=capped><span>How to preserve that practice</span> has been an important
consideration for Meredith as well as the House Foundation for the Arts, the
charitable organization that supports Meredith’s work.—At this point, I must
acknowledge that the executive director of the foundation carries much of the
burden of taking a very distinct artistic vision and turning it into reality,
which is limited by space, time, and funds. I had the pleasure of personally
interacting with executive directors Barbara Dufty, Olivia Georgia, and Kristin
Kapustik on many an occasion, and I am in awe of their work. Thank you!—But back
to Meredith creating a new oral tradition: The very beauty of a city like New
York is its lively arts scene. Yes, it is a mere shadow of the arts scene during
the 1970s and 1980s, with many, especially younger artists displaced to
neighboring Philadelphia or even far-away Detroit no thanks to ever rising real
estate prices. Yet art still is what brings us together in this city.</p>

<p>As a result, the many efforts towards teaching and preserving the extended
vocal technique, emotion, and wisdom of Meredith’s work are finding ready
practitioners and thus are starting to pay off. For instance, in <time
datetime=2017-10-20>October 2017</time> at Lincoln Center’s White Light
Festival, 21 choristers—some so young they seemingly just started
kindergarten—from the Young People’s Chorus of New York City joined the ensemble
to perform <cite>Dancing Voices</cite>. A few months later in <time
datetime=2018-03-14>March 2018</time>, several choristers again joined the
ensemble, this time at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for the amazing final
moments of <cite>Cellular Songs</cite>. Having had the good fortune to be
present for both events, I immediately saw the connection and am deeply
appreciative of Meredith incorporating those young performers in what—in no
small part thanks to them—turned out to be the grand finale of her latest
work.</p>

<p>The changing ensemble itself also reflects this quest for continuity.
<cite>Cellular Songs</cite>’ Ellen Fisher, Katie Geissinger, and Allison Sniffin
have been performing with Meredith for decades. Out of such a long and intense
association comes a deep bond. I vividly remember Katie and Meredith performing
a duet at Dancing Voices because, while I had seen both perform that same song
several times, I had never noticed the love in Katie’s eyes before. That would
be the purest love of all, the one that sees the other and accepts her
unconditionally. But <cite>Cellular Songs</cite> very much includes a fifth
woman, Jo Stewart. She may be considerably younger than the other four, but she
certainly is performing as a peer. That is an amazing exchange to behold. The
older women have accepted Jo into the ensemble and Jo has made Meredith’s new
oral tradition her own.</p>

<p>The way <cite>Cellular Songs</cite> marks a rite of passage and also
continuity reminds me of African and Australian Aboriginal tribes, who also
practice art by passing performative and thereby sacred knowledge from
generation to generation. As an example, I <time
datetime=2018-04-15>recently</time> had the distinct pleasure of seeing Trio Da
Kali from Mali perform in New York City. The trio’s female vocalist, Hawa
Diabaté, performed with such skill and depth, she single-handedly summoned the
hot winds of Western Africa, from her home country at the edge of the Sahara to
Brooklyn on a cold and rainy night. I swear, I could feel them blowing through
the concert venue. And I was not alone. My friend Ako, who joined me for the
show and whose father stems from nearby Ghana, reported feeling connected to her
father more than seemingly possible an ocean apart from the place of his birth
and also untimely death.</p>

<!--
  The elder Diabaté died a little more than a month later, on 24 May
  2018. He was only 69 years old.
  -->

<p>At some point during that amazing show, the vocalist’s father Kassé Mady
Diabaté joined her on stage for a few songs. And suddenly the threshold of
revelation became tangible: He too had that same skill and emotional depth to
his singing. It distinctly is more than a performance to be witnessed or some
recorded artifact to be consumed. It is a tradition and a way of life. That
observation equally applies to Meredith Monk. Just maybe, Meredith’s visionary
vision really is the seed for a new tribal art tradition, only this time the
tribe emerges out of the urban jungle that is New York. The world would
certainly be richer and stronger for it.</p>

<p><cite>Cellular Songs</cite> is astonishing for two other reasons. First, a
real challenge for an accomplished artist like Meredith Monk or the German
painter Peter Tomschiczek—I happen to know Peter since childhood and both
Meredith’s and Peter’s art adorns the walls of my apartment—is how to stay
true to both yourself and your artistic vision without falling into the trap of
increasingly mindless repetition. That trap is powerful because you just know
that the repetition will find appreciation and even success. It probably is best
illustrated by the many once ground-breaking and youthfully rebellious rock
bands now performing the same set of songs over and over again to sport stadiums
full of middle-aged people. It’s not that we don’t appreciate the performance,
we most certainly do. But something essential to art has gone missing.</p>

<p><cite>Cellular Songs</cite> points towards a remarkable solution for avoiding
that trap. Meredith pared down her already sparse performative style to the bare
essentials, possibly even less, to the point where it almost becomes a living
glyph. That would not be the kind of glyph sent as warning to burn in the desert
at night. But it nonetheless is a glyph of similar revelatory impact. That
realization struck me as I was watching the five women stage <cite>Cellular
Songs</cite>. At some point, a cell, really Jo Stewart, dies right there on
stage while the other cells, really the other four women, tend and comfort her.
All this was realized with highly stylized, sparse motion—remember that
earlier disclaimer about having missed the motion; you really gotta be there if
you can—and with only occasional hissing or clicking sounds. Yet the moment
hit hard and stuck with me. I can feel shivers running down my spine as I write
this. You really gotta be there if you can!</p>

<p>Second, <cite>Cellular Songs</cite> dispenses with male performers. This is
not a principled rejection of men. Together with Meredith, Yoshio Yabara again
delivered outstanding installation including costume design. When I tried to
compliment him, he even had the good graces to admit that the visually striking
contrast between white materials that reflected black light and those that
didn’t was a fortuitous accident. But at a time when women finally had more than
enough of toxic masculinity, it feels just right that <cite>Cellular
Songs</cite> places women front and center. That is my take. But it also about
sums up Meredith’s take. She told me so, when I asked her about it after the
work-in-progress performance in <time datetime=2017-06-08>June 2017</time>. That
performance, by the way, was a special treat because it provided a glimpse into
a very organic process. The contours of the official performance a year later
were very much the same. Yet the details quite clearly evolved and probably will
continue to evolve.</p>

<p>That emphasis on organic growth and change was very much front and center
during a private concert <time datetime=2018-05-23>towards the end of May
2018</time> as well. As it turns out, money cannot buy happiness, but it can
very much support an artist and her ensemble while also providing access to a
spectacular experience. At that concert, Allison, Katie, and Meredith performed
songs spanning a beautiful and varied repertoire. In the intimacy of a Brooklyn
brownstone, with only 30 patrons attending, many a song took on an emotional
immediacy and force that rendered me close to tears for much of the show, yet
also had me burst out laughing once or twice. That show also marks a uniquely
odd or oddly unique occasion, since the set list comprised almost only songs
with words, as Meredith acknowledged mid-set much to her own surprise.</p>

<p>When performing <cite>Memory Song</cite>—a song written in mid 1980s Berlin
in memory and warning of fascism and nuclear holocaust, a threat made tangible
then by the <abbr>US</abbr> installing Pershing 2 missiles all over Germany,
which also marked the point of my own political awakening—I was waiting for
Allison to provide her usual counterpoint with the violin but instead Katie did
so by vocalizing the same melody. It wasn’t that Allison didn’t have her violin
with her. She pulled it out for the next song. No, the three women had changed
the instrumentation of a familiar song, giving it renewed haunting license in
these times of renewed nuclear threat. That subtle yet deliberate change stands
in sharp contrast to the dictatorial male authorship of a George Lucas, who not
only keeps on rewriting dear movies to suit his whims but also deprives us of
previous versions along the way. Not so Allison, Katie, and Meredith: Both
versions continue to exist, in a sonic garden marked by many a performance and
recording, with the women gingerly tending to its plants and gently nurturing
them to bloom after bloom.</p>

<div class=heading>
<h2 id=the-journey class=belyssimo>Companions and Campfires</h2>
</div>

<p class=capped><span>So, here we find ourselves</span> almost 2,800 words into
what is intended to be a personal appraisal and yet, in passages so far, almost
reads like a hagiography. In doing so, I have jumped from tender beginnings
right to the current end, thus letting me take stock, ascertain, and weigh. That
decisiveness of the critic—which reminds of a Caesar declaring <i lang=la
translate=no title="I came, I saw, I conquered">veni, vidi, vici</i>—may be
necessary at times. But it also appears somewhat out of place in an appraisal
that tries hard to give a female artist and creator of a new oral herstory her
proper due. Still, I can’t take the male author out of this piece. My own
maleness distinctly is part of who I am and how I write. And in being secure in
my masculinity, I can also be secure in my purse-carrying femininity. But I can
always do more of what we men too often forget to do, namely to listen.
Thankfully, this appraisal is grounded in the very act of listening and the act
of writing has provided ample of opportunity to listen again and to listen
closely. But nonetheless it is time for a change of tone and also direction.
Because, if you listen, you cannot but hear that Meredith’s work is less
concerned with the ends as well. Instead, Meredith’s work is consistently
concerned with the journey, both literally and figuratively.</p>

<p>One of those journeys is Meredith’s opera <cite>Atlas</cite>. Loosely
inspired by the life and writings of real world explorer Alexandra David-Néel,
the opera marks a journey that may start like many a journey, with plans made
around the dining room table and teary farewells said at the airport. But it
also is quite distinct. There is the choosing of companions, with my own
introduction being a huge bouquet of wild-ish flowers I dropped off at the stage
door when Meredith and ensemble were performing <cite>Atlas</cite> over the
summer of 2001 in Berlin. Meredith graciously acknowledged the flowers in a
postcard poignantly sent from Meredith <abbr>NY</abbr> later that fall.</p>

<p><i>Has anything changed?</i> I had my actual audition <time
datetime=2005-06-05>over the summer of 2005</time> in Meredith’s loft. Kidding!
I can neither sing nor move nor do both at the same time. But after
participating in a one day workshop with Meredith, I can attest that she is a
most patient and inspiring teacher of her extended vocal technique and all that
entails.</p>

<p><i>Can I find love?</i> There are the campfires as the companions huddle
tight at night. I had the distinct pleasure of serving on the board of the House
Foundation from 2004 to 2009, with, amongst others, Haruno Arai, Ellynne Skove,
and Frederieke Taylor as companions. Sadly, Frederieke passed this February and
now is neither hungry ghost, nor ice demon, nor lonely spirit, but our guide
from above. In life, she was a most amazing and generous patron and dealer of
the arts. She also gave me the critical advice that turned a hobby into art,
directly leading to my first group shows and competition win. I am so glad I got
to thank her in person and exhort you to do the same for your mentors. It makes
all the difference in this world.</p>

<p><i>But I still hear noise.</i> Over the years, the most festive campfire with
the most celebratory crowd of companions certainly was <cite>Making Music</cite>
at Carnegie Hall in <time datetime=2005-11-06>November 2005</time>. It was a
four hour marathon of all things Monk, which even included Björk’s only public
performance that year. If there was a pristine audio recording of the
proceedings, then you could consistently hear my delighted whoops and yells from
my first row seat. But unfortunately there isn’t such a recording—at least not
officially. Talking about Björk, in <time datetime=2009-03-05>March 2009</time>,
I had the pleasure of lying a couple of feet away from her on the floor of the
Guggenheim, while all of us were enchantedly listening to Meredith and ensemble
performing <cite>Songs of Ascension</cite> in the rotunda above us. Wow, what a
magical experience!</p>

<p><i>What is pain?</i> <time datetime=2008-05-21>One day in 2008</time>, we
held a board meeting at my new, new apartment in Brooklyn. One of the wild
beasts circling that particular campfire was my cat Esteban. Meredith was
already uncomfortable because she had forgotten to take her antihistamines
against cat allergy, and Esteban certainly didn’t help matters when, after
inspecting and ignoring every other companion, he jumped straight onto
Meredith’s lap. I am glad that this encounter with the beasts of Brooklyn didn’t
prevent Meredith from attending the glorious ceremony in her honor for the
Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize on the same block in <time
datetime=2017-10-26>October 2017</time>. I am equally glad that I got to be
