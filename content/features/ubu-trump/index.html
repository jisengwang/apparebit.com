<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p class=capped><span>A reassuring constant</span> during much of the
presidential primaries and then again during the general election campaign was a
seeming consensus between political journalism, opinion polls, and betting
markets that the odds of Donald Trump winning were small. This failure to
predict the future based not just on observation and opinion but also extensive
analysis of demographic data lead to <a
href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-i-acted-like-a-pundit-and-screwed-up-on-donald-trump/">much
hand-wringing</a> after the primaries, <a
href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-missed-trump-we-asked-pollsters-why/">only
to be repeated</a> half a year later after the election. In retrospect however,
it almost seems predictable that journalists, pollsters, and bookies would get
it wrong. After all, predictive models work best for a narrow band of
<em>normal</em> events. Yet as I will argue in this essay, Mr Trump’s campaign
strategy and motivation for running are anything but normal. Interestingly, the
data does support the hypothesis that voters, unlike professional soothsayers,
were well aware of Mr Trump’s outlier status: Critical majorities only formed
during the last few weeks <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republican-voters-decided-on-trump/">of
the primaries</a>
and <a
href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voters-really-did-switch-to-trump-at-the-last-minute/">before
the general election</a> alike, with voters apparently having decided <em>to
hell with it</em>!</p>

<p>The liberating effects of flirting with nihilism notwithstanding, large parts
of a society becoming devoted disciples is bound to end badly. Ironically, it is
a former pundit, Andrew Sullivan, who realizes the full extent of the threat and
argues that the <abbr>US</abbr> has <q><a
href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/04/america-tyranny-donald-trump.html">never
been so ripe for tyranny</a></q> in an equally insightful and chilling
analysis-cum-essay published a few days before Mr Trump’s primary victory. Mr
Sullivan’s final exhortation—that in <q>terms of our liberal democracy and
constitutional order, Trump is an extinction-level event</q>—seems as acute
today as it was in early May. Despite all its merits, Mr Sullivan’s account
suffers from one short-coming: Having been published more than half a year ago
and exploring some of the larger societal and cultural forces, it is necessarily
short on the particulars of Mr Trump coming to power and thus presents only an
incomplete picture. As I am advancing through my own version of Kübler-Ross’s
five stages of grief—starting with physical shock upon learning the election
result, then seething anger at this country’s voters, then fantasies of starting
a new life far away, then deep and inconsolable depression—I am hereby offering
my own, complementary analysis as an entry ticket to the fifth stage, principled
rejection of Mr Trump and everything he stands for.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the goal of this essay is to offer an objective historical
analysis, insofar as can be written by a contemporaneous witness. For that
reason, all major claims link to supporting evidence. I may only provide one
representative link, but each claim is easy enough to corroborate. Having said
that, distinguishing between truth and fiction amongst the totality of Mr
Trump’s public statements can be challenging. Yet, his public record on
electoral strategy, the presidency as a business opportunity, economic
nationalism, and authoritarian tendencies is in fact consistent—with many of
the same statements predating his presidential run. In short, if you try to
objectively analyze Mr Trump’s campaign and record, I would be surprised if
you arrived at a radically different conclusion.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=the-donald-starts>
<h2 id=the-donald-starts>The Donald Starts a Circus</h2>

<p class=capped><span>Any understanding of Donald Trump</span> must start with
an acknowledgement that he intuitively recognized and flawlessly executed a
brilliant strategy for winning the <abbr>US</abbr> presidency. That strategy is
centered around three pillars. First, he recognized that established political
wisdom for once is too forward-looking: The <abbr>US</abbr>
population shift towards a more balanced racial and ethnical distribution has
only just begun. In the trend-setting age bracket of 0 to 4 inclusive, the share
of non-Hispanic whites <a
href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/07/06/its-official-the-us-is-becoming-a-minority-majority-nation">recently
dropped below 50%</a>. That same trend <a
href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/02/03/2016-electorate-will-be-the-most-diverse-in-u-s-history/">is
much less pronounced</a> for eligible voters, with the share of non-Hispanic
whites dropping from 71% to 69% over President Obama’s second term. This is
hardly surprising, since eligible voters necessarily are older than our
trend-setters. If you factor in voter turnout, which further skews towards old
age, the effective <abbr>US</abbr> electorate still is very much white. Now,
whereas educated whites tend to be aligned with the Democratic Party,
less-educated or non-college whites are underserved by the mainstreams of either
political party and thus can become election-making—if they can be motivated to
vote.</p>

<p>Second, the cost of mounting a national campaign is rapidly becoming
prohibitive, with only the best connected professionals, i.e., politicians,
standing a chance and only if they spend most of their time fundraising. So
what is a non-professional and property tycoon of uncertain wealth to do?
Conveniently, his target constituency tend to be low-information voters, who
are more susceptible to emotional appeals. So Mr Trump sets out to punk the
media. With an outrage a day, he generates plenty of free headlines and
dominates the discussion on television, where pompous airheads sell
sensationalism and outrage as news. Twitter turns out to be the perfect
platform for stoking the fire. Its <time datetime=2017-01-13>current</time>
140 character limit invites oversimplification at best and invective
at worst. It also ensures that almost any post can serve as thrilling
soundbite. Maybe for that reason, Twitter enjoys must-read status
amongst media types, who so adore the microblogging service they
usually quote posts with styling and interactive features intact. In
short, many media organizations seem all too happy to serve as clowns
to Mr Trump’s ringmaster and to provide maximum amplification for his
over-the-top pronouncements.</p>

<p>The results are striking. According to <a
href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16">an analysis of Federal Election
Commission data</a> by the Center for Responsive Politics, Hillary Clinton and
aligned outside groups spent about 700 million dollars on her losing campaign.
In contrast, Donald Trump and aligned outside groups spent only 45% as much, or
about 320 million dollars. <a
href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/26816/has-every-u-s-presidential-election-been-won-by-the-campaign-with-the-most-mone">To
put this in perspective</a>, the Democratic and Republican candidates for
president have been spending roughly the same amounts for 10 out of 15 races
since <time>1960</time>. For the other five races, namely Goldwater vs Johnson
in <time>1964</time>, Nixon vs Humphrey in <time>1968</time>, Nixon vs McGovern
in <time>1972</time>, Obama vs McCain in <time>2008</time>, and of course
Clinton vs Trump in <time>2016</time>, the first listed candidate outspent the
second by roughly a factor of two. Yet only Mr Johnson and Mr Trump managed to
beat their spendthrift opponents!</p>

<p>In fact, Mr Trump’s trolling on Twitter works so well, he is still at it. An
instructive example are events a week and a half after the election. On that
Friday, the president-elect <a
href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/11/what-the-trump-u-case-and-trumps-candidacy-have-in-common.html">settled
three lawsuits</a> resulting from his so-called university. Now that
organization never was accredited as such and appears much closer to classic
seminar fraud than an educational institution. Yet Mr Trump is able to settle
for 25 million dollars, 15 million less than the plaintiffs lost by purchasing
useless seminars. That same Friday, the vice-president-elect attended a Broadway
show and <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/19/mike-pence-booed-at-hamilton-performance-then-hears-diversity-plea">experienced
a rather confrontational reception</a> from actors and audience alike. One might
be tempted to consider the settlement the more significant event of the day,
since it directly reflects on Mr Trump’s business ethics or lack thereof. But
the “news” over that weekend is the incident at the Broadway show—thanks to
three choice tweets by Mr Trump!</p>

<p>In one of these posts, Mr Trump declares that <q>The Theater must always be a
safe and special place.</q> The emphasis on the capitalized <q>The Theater</q>
being both <q>safe</q> and <q>special</q> is curious. After all, there is no
single, unifying theater experience even on Broadway, where oddball shows such
as <cite>Hamilton</cite>—the very rap musical about one of the founding fathers
attended by the vice-president-elect—may just turn into run-away successes.
Furthermore, a production being safe typically precludes it being special.
Now, it is entirely possible that Mr Trump turns sentimental the moment he
enters a midtown theater and yearns to restore Broadway to its former glory,
from an age before television nonetheless. But more likely is that he simply
assumes a character suitable for posting on Twitter—in this case, an aging
theater queen who waxes nostalgic about bygone days while hectoring everyone
alive.</p>

<p>Third, Mr Trump recognizes in himself the perfect person to execute this
strategy. He certainly has honed the skills necessary for making concise and
sometimes funny, sometimes barbed comments over years of hosting a reality
<abbr>TV</abbr> show. He also seems no stranger to boorish behavior in his
private life. At least, <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html">Mr
Trump suggests as much himself</a> in a <time>2005</time> exchange with another
<abbr>TV</abbr> host, which was surreptitiously recorded. But he also is
synonymous with a globally recognized, aspirational brand that sells a somewhat
gaudy, always pretentious vision of luxury. The importance of the duality
between Trump the Troll and Mr Trump, Purveyor of Recognizable Luxury, is hard
to overstate. The troll makes him stand out and thus able to reach, even rouse
people who feel very much neglected and hostile towards politicians. It also
establishes authenticity, when people might recognize the purveyor for being a
fraud. The purveyor in turn encourages people to dream of a future that may not
look like a Trump luxury resort but sure feels like one. It also restores
credibility when people tire of the ringmaster dominating the media circus.</p>

<p>Mr Trump’s strategy has clear upsides in terms of the prestige and power
associated with the <abbr>US</abbr> presidency. But it also is exceedingly
risky. It is bound to alienate many people and thus directly threatens Mr
Trump’s lifestyle brand, potentially spelling an end to his business ventures.
Quite obviously, such an undertaking calls for a trial run with comparably lower
stakes. Looking back five years, Mr Trump seems to have done just that when he
very publicly and very persistently <a
href="https://thinkprogress.org/there-is-no-absolution-for-trump-on-birtherism-cfb255591cf9">embraced
birtherism</a>—the deeply racist fantasy that Mr Obama would not qualify for
president because of a foreign birth—and encountered few negative consequences
for himself or his <abbr>TV</abbr> show. In fact, key elements of his strategy
have become more acceptable in the intervening years thanks to the Republican
Party. By increasingly promoting asocial behavior as freedom, to wit healthcare,
and denying basic truths, to wit climate change, the
<abbr>GOP</abbr> has not only normalized key elements of Mr Trump’s platform
but also created the conditions leading to his more or less hostile take-over
of the party.</p>

<p>Sadly, the two Democratic contenders directly aided Mr Trump in executing his
winning strategy. While Mr Trump was honing his skills and taking out 15 other
contenders for the Republican nomination, Mr Sanders was busy normalizing key
elements of Mr Trump’s platform by using the same anti-globalization and “the
game is rigged” rhetoric. Like Mr Trump, he also seemed a little too dependent
on the adulation of his supporters, continuing his primary campaign well past
the tipping point. It is, however, Mrs Clinton who all but ensured Mr Trump’s
election. Fifteen months ahead of her first senate run in <time>2000</time>, Mrs
Clinton embarked on a <q><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/26/nyregion/mrs-clinton-s-listening-tour-now-evolving-into-senate-campaign.html">listening
tour</a></q> through New York State. She connected with the full spectrum of the
state’s voters and crafted a broadly appealing platform out of that experience.
It appears that this time around she couldn’t be bothered with the business of
pressing hands for too long. Instead she spent August socializing and
fundraising <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fundraising.html">in
the Hamptons</a>. Fresh from her month amongst the ultra-rich, she publicly
called many of Mr Trump’s supporters <q><a href="https://time.com/4486502/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-transcript/">deplorables</a>.</q>
Is it any surprise then that only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html">28%
of whites without a college degree</a> voted for Mrs Clinton compared to Mr
Trump’s 67%?</p>

<section aria-labelledby=president-trump>
<h2 id=president-trump>President Trump Means Business</h2>

<p class=capped><span>Wander through New York City’s midtown</span> and you will
encounter many a building directly inspired by <a
href="https://www.miessociety.org/the-legacy">Mies van der Rohe’s Second
Chicago School</a>. Its emphasis on aesthetic minimalism and the use of glass
and steel provide the <abbr>DNA</abbr> for all skyscrapers. Technological
advances may have enabled the more organic forms of Mies’ post-modern and
post-post-modern successors, but modernism continues to be the standard by which
all skyscrapers are judged. At first glance, the tower at the corner of Fifth
Avenue and 56<sup class=ordinal>th</sup> Street (pictured above) does not stand
out. Look a little closer and you do notice the sawtooth of the effectively
diagonal cut-off. Clearly, this particular building is designed to maximize
views at the cost of floor space, which makes sense for a high-end residential
tower in the area. As you work your way past newly erected security barriers
towards the lobby entrance, you take in the <a
href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/New_York_City_Mai_2009_PD_044.JPG">blocky
lettering of <em>Trump Tower</em></a> above. It provides the definitive clue for
recognizing the building as a product of the early 1980s. But you are
preoccupied with the security screening and barely register the rosy-golden glow
of the marble lobby, when secret service personnel whisk you to the elevator. Up
you go.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/melania-trump-interview-pictures">And
step into Versailles</a>? The president-elect’s sitting room, in its ornate
gilded opulence from marble floors to Louis <span class=roman>XIV</span>
chairs with the Trump coat of arms to ceiling frescos, negates not only the
surrounding city, which stands as the very archetype of the modern metropolis.
Its stylistic language even predates enlightenment, which provides the
intellectual foundation for this country. This visual tour de force is <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/t-magazine/angelo-donghia-80s-interior-designer.html">the
work of Angelo Donghia</a>, who served as the interior designer of New York’s
rich and famous until his untimely death from the plague in <time>1985</time>.
Mr Donghia prided himself for not forcing a particular style onto his clients
but rather having his work reflect the moment and the client. No stranger to
grand gestures, Mr Donghia certainly went all out and then some for Mr Trump,
resulting in rooms that not only glorify their owner but also capture his sense
of self, as absolute ruler over his domain. It is telling that in 35 plus years
since creation of his Versailles-Upon-Manhattan Mr Trump never saw fit to
redecorate, that neither the second nor third wife were able to leave their own
imprint despite the design of the penthouse palace dating from his first
marriage.</p>

<p>Viewed through the prism of the self-styled potentate, Mr Trump’s views and
actions over the years at least seem more consistent. We would expect Mr Trump
to name each and every business endeavor after himself. After all, there is no
name like his name. We would expect him to be exceedingly comfortable with a
reality <abbr>TV</abbr> format that bestows onto him the simultaneous roles of
judge, jury, and executioner. After all, that is who he is. We would expect his
family to play an outsized role in organizing the party convention, planning the
presidential transition, and taking over the day-to-day of his business. After
all, he is the family and the family is his. Ties created by blood and marriage
always supersede the benign interests of aligned professionals. We would expect
him to feel rather unconstrained by civil contracts, parting with his wealth
only as long as he pleases. After all, his generosity is his to bestow and also
<a
href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/">his
to withhold</a>, even from the lawyers called upon to defend his whim. Finally,
we would expect him to be oversensitive to criticism and to admire others of
similar extraction. After all, he knows deep down that the emperor has no
clothes and idolizes those who can pretend otherwise.</p>

<p>The image of Mr Trump as monarch-in-waiting resonates because it does
provide a consistent explanation for some of his more visible behaviors. At
the same time, it verges on caricature. Yet much of the campaign demonstrates
that the spectacle of mockery and ridicule directed at Mr Trump and by Mr
Trump can serve as a potent distraction while he goes for the win. So it
behooves us to complicate our picture. As good a starting point as any is Mr
Trump’s relationship with the press. As I have argued above, adept
manipulation of what passes for television “news” in this country was an
integral part of Mr Trump winning the election. In turn, the campaign circus
with Mr Trump as ringmaster significantly boosted viewership of
<abbr>CNN</abbr>, Fox “News”, and <abbr>MSNBC</abbr>, with the former two
charging advertisers <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-21/trump-versus-clinton-has-cable-news-prepping-for-ratings-jackpot">up
to 40 times their usual rates</a>. Meanwhile, more traditional news media were
far more distanced and critical. Out of the nation’s 100 largest newspapers,
<a
href="https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/304606-final-newspaper-endorsement-count-clinton-57-trump-2/">only
two endorsed Mr Trump</a>, whereas 57 endorsed Hillary Clinton. This more
critical stance was not lost on Mr Trump. In one of the campaign’s more chilling
moments, <a
href="https://www.cjr.org/first_person/donald_trump_lawsuit_new_york_times.php">he
threatened</a> the New York Times and Washington Post with <q>open[ing] up our
libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false
articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.</q></p>

<p>Interestingly, his objection seems less about inaccurate reporting. Instead
he seems personally offended and repelled by the portrait the press is painting
of him and his past. In fact, Mr Trump openly <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/us/politics/donald-trump-interviews.html">admitted
to a reporter in <time>2014</time></a>, <q>I don’t like to analyze myself
because I might not like what I see.</q> He further elaborated, <q>I don’t like
talking about the past,</q> only to emphasize that <q>it’s all about the present
and the future.</q> One bellwether of that present and future used to be the
press, who kept on mentioning him. <q>There are thousands of them a day,</q> he
boasted to the same reporter. <q>Thousands, thousands a day.</q> Yet despite the
putative accolades, he can’t sit still. <q>I’ve had these tremendous successes
and then I’m off to the next one. Because, it’s like, ‘<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCRZZC-DH7M">Oh, is that all there
is?</a>’</q> And so Peggy Lee’s unflinching rendition of a song written by two
American Jews, inspired by a story by one of Germany’s great writers, Thomas
Mann, and performed in the style of one of Germany’s great composers, Kurt
Weill, marks the emotional nadir of Donald Trump, himself <a
href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trumps-grandfather-banished-germany-records-reveal-freidrich-kallstadt-a7430636.html">the
grandson of a banished German draft dodger</a>.</p>

<p>But what a difference an election makes! To be sure, Mr Trump still is no fan
of a critical press, repeatedly ditching the pool of reporters, who are supposed
to follow the president (elect) at all times, and instead resorting to the
megaphone of Twitter, which keeps the backtalk to a minimum. But at least he
pretends to play ball and, after some contrary foreplay on his favorite
microblog, sits down with reporters, editors, and columnists of the New York
Times for <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/trump-new-york-times-interview-transcript.html">a
lengthy on-the-record interview</a>. Meanwhile, he directs his most menacing
scorn at television hosts and executives, who trudge over to Trump Tower and
present themselves as supplicants at Versailles-Upon-Manhattan. This
off-the-record dressing down, <a
href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/11/trump-media-sit-down-a-f-king-firing-squad.html">immediately
leaked to the press</a>, suggests that Mr Trump is dead set on turning erstwhile
circus clowns into fawning sycophants. Then again, he is right on target when
criticizing <abbr>TV</abbr> bigwigs for not understanding the dynamics of this
election. And <abbr>CNN</abbr>’s conduct during the election was indeed
deplorable, notably when hiring <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trouble-with-corey-lewandowski-on-cnn">former
campaign manager Corey Lewandowski</a> while still on Mr Trump’s payroll.</p>

<p>Based on the characterization of Mr Trump so far, we might conclude that his
primary motivation for running is confirmation of his self-perceived status and
elevation of his name from curiosity to chapter in the nation’s history. While
both play a role, we must not forget his mercantilistic impulses, which remind
me of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328211624/http://www.startrek.com/database_article/ferengi">the
Ferengi</a>, an alien race from the Star Trek universe who also are obsessed
with profit and suffer the same rampant misogyny. To fully appreciate Mr Trump’s
motivation, we need to consider one more factor.</p>

<p>One of the many existential threats to kleptocrats the world over is the law.
They may rewrite the very rules that bind their societies. But they are almost
always slower at rewriting than at breaking the law. And so the law may just
catch up, as it did with Mr Berlusconi, who for nine years managed to evade
criminal investigation after criminal investigation allowing him to become the
longest-serving prime minister of Italy after World War <span
class=roman>II</span>. But in a stunning oversight, neither the founding fathers
nor Congress ever saw fit to codify the president’s outside interests. Mr Trump
has made it amply clear that he is not only fully aware of this legal anomaly,
but he also intends to exploit to its fullest. <q>It’s very possible that I
could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,</q> Mr
Trump stated for a <a
href="https://fortune.com/2000/04/03/what-does-donald-trump-really-want/">profile
in Fortune Magazine in <time>2000</time></a>. <q>Nothing is written. In other
words, in theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business
100 percent,</q> he observed sixteen year later in his post-election <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/trump-new-york-times-interview-transcript.html">interview
with the New York Times</a>. He is not content to be yet another tycoon turned a
nation’s possibly corrupt leader. Rather his true innovation is to recognize the
<abbr>US</abbr>
presidency as a legitimate business opportunity. The presidency
effectively becomes subjugated to and part of the Trump brand. The
prestige and power of the president are now up for sale, commerce as
usual.</p>

<h2 id=of-the-people>Of the People, By the People, For the People</h2>

<p class=capped><span>Even with this understanding</span> of Mr Trump’s
motivation for running for president, the question remains: What is all the
innovation in campaigning and the corresponding harm to the democratic process
good for? To enrich himself during his remaining years on earth as the oldest
president-elect in <abbr>US</abbr> history? To enrich his family when worldly
fortunes are typically <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180807104450/https://time.com/money/3925308/rich-families-lose-wealth/">lost
by the next generation</a>, if not the following one? More importantly, what
about the people he is supposed to represent?</p>

<p>Let’s start with non-college whites, many of whom live across the <em>Rust
Belt</em> of Great Lakes, Midwest, and North-Eastern states. These states
served as the central hub of heavy industry and manufacturing in the
<abbr>US</abbr> from the late 19<sup class=ordinal>th</sup> century well into
World War <span class=roman>II</span>. They took a turn for the worse during the
1950s and 1960s, which was partially caused by a population shift towards the
coasts, and then underwent large-scale deindustrialization over the following 40
years. Since this devastating decline was a direct consequence of globalization
and its sidekick automation, inhabitants of the Rust Belt can be forgiven for
being responsive to Mr Trump’s anti-globalization plank. But that same hostility
towards international trade has already cost us dearly. Thanks to Mr Trump’s
election and despite over a decade of preparations, major trade agreements with
Pacific Rim countries and the European Union have already collapsed. For the
trans-pacific agreement alone, Americans missed out on <a
href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2016/04/02/trade-at-what-price">a
$131 billion income boost</a>, or 0.5% of this country’s <abbr>GDP</abbr>. While
it is a bit difficult to miss income one never had, the president-elect is also
floating a plan <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-policy-lead-to-global-recession-2016-12">for
a 5% tariff on all imports</a>. Given the deep integration of global supply
chains, that levy would result in higher <abbr>US</abbr> prices from day one. It
would also trigger trade wars with our main suppliers, notably China, thus
increasing prices even more. In short, non-college whites bore the brunt of
globalization’s negative effects in this country and hence became
election-making for Mr Trump. Yet by opposing globalization, they may have set
themselves up for a second helping of misery—unless the incoming administration
embarks on unheard-of and sustained infrastructure spending.</p>

<p>In the heady days after the election, Mr Trump’s chief strategist, Steve
Bannon, indeed <a
href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/steve-bannon-trump-tower-interview-trumps-strategist-plots-new-political-movement-948747/">suggested
such a tantalizing vision</a>. <q>With negative interest rates throughout the
world, it’s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Shipyards,
ironworks, get them all jacked up. We’re just going to throw it up against the
wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the
Reagan revolution—conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist
movement.</q> To this German, who grew up in a household steeped in the horrors
of the Shoah, Mr Bannon’s casual praise for the 1930s was contemptible. But more
to the point, Mr Bannon articulated a viable approach for elevating the fortunes
of Rust Belt inhabitants and thereby ensuring the success of the president-elect
and any like-minded, if not like-named successor. But then Mr Trump started
nominating the members of his cabinet. The most canny choice seems to be that of
<a
href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2016/12/17/give-rex-a-chance">Rex
Tillerson as secretary of state</a>. When engaging Russia on rebuilding a
devastated Syria or <a
href="https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2017/01/06/intelligence-report-says-putin-ordered-a-campaign-to-help-trump">ceasing
<abbr>US</abbr> electoral interference</a>, Mr Tillerson can draw on almost a
decade’s experience of working with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr
Tillerson has also demonstrated that he will stand up to Mr Putin, lest his
deals don’t pass muster back home. Sadly, most of Mr Trump’s other nominations
are forgettable ideologues, who may be qualified to dismantle the government but
not to govern the huge, multi-year, inter-departmental effort envisioned by Mr
Bannon. By handing out patronage through cabinet positions instead of assembling
a great team for revitalizing the Rust Belt, the president-elect missed a great
opportunity for effecting positive change. He also failed his main
constituency.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the new Republican congressional majority, which was elected on
the same day as Mr Trump, has been bending over backwards to explore options for
repealing President Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act.
While they loudly pretended to do just that more than 60 times over the last six
years, they also relied on Mr Obama’s veto for saving them from their own worst
dogmatic impulses. Starting <time datetime=2017-01-20>January 20<sup
class=ordinal>th</sup></time>, they will not have this luxury anymore. As a
result, some Republicans are belatedly becoming attuned to Obamacare’s carefully
orchestrated interplay between individual mandates, government subsidies, and
ban on coverage restrictions. The most benign repeal option being floated does
reflect this awakening and proposes to make cosmetic changes only, while still
putting on a big show about having vanquished the socialist monstrosity. More
serious options for repeal are certainly still being explored, but have also
become more politically sensitive since the election. In an inspired analysis,
The Economist showed that there is one marginally more accurate predictor for <a
href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2016/11/19/illness-as-indicator">a
county swinging to Mr Trump</a> than its fraction of non-college whites. That
predictor is <q>the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, heavy drinking, and
physical activity (or lack thereof).</q> In other words, <q>the specific subset
of Mr Trump’s voters that won him the election […] live in communities that are
literally dying.</q> Yet many of these same people are amongst the roughly
twenty million people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306012646/https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2016/03/03/20-million-people-have-gained-health-insurance-coverage-because-affordable-care-act-new-estimates">newly
insured through Obamacare</a> and given their ill-wealth and ill-health <a
href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/12/13/13848794/kentucky-obamacare-trump">very
much depend on its coverage</a>. With Rust Belt reality putting a very human
face on the issue of health care access, the concept of collective well-being is
becoming less abstract than that of individual freedom. And thanks to this
reversal over six years ago, the repeal effort is starting to look a bit less
certain.</p>

<p>Still, the spectacle of Republicans preparing to unravel the legacy of the
United States’ first black president serves as a poignant reminder of the racism
Mr Trump injected into his campaign from day one. During the press conference
announcing his run, he introduced his idea for a Great Wall of Mexico <a
href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/16/8789885/donald-trump-president-shocking">with
the assertion</a> that these many Mexicans <q>are bringing drugs. They’re
bringing crime. They’re rapists.</q> Mr Trump did mention one alleged Mexican by
name a few weeks later, but <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-keeps-up-attacks-on-judge-gonzalo-curiel-1464911442">only
to argue</a> that <abbr>US</abbr> District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was unsuitable
to presiding over two of the Trump University lawsuits. According to the
president-elect’s nicely circular argument, Mr Curiel is <q>of Mexican
heritage</q> and thus has <q>an absolute conflict</q> given that Mr Trump is
<q>building a wall.</q> Seemingly on a roll, Mr Trump next called <q>for a total
and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.</q> To justify
targeting only the adherents of the world’s second-largest religion, Mr Trump
quoted a survey of Muslims <a
href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9867900/donald-trump-muslims">showing rather
unpleasant attitudes</a> towards the <abbr>US</abbr> and her people. That same
day, the survey was exposed as deeply flawed and utterly biased. Yet Mr Trump
was still <a
href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/11/11200316/5-key-moments-republican-debate-miami">peddling
the fabrication</a> of <q>a lot of them</q> hating the <abbr>US</abbr> many
months later. In stark contrast to Muslims, Mr Trump seems incapable of finding
fault with whites and <a
href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/28/11129120/donald-trump-david-duke">refused to
disavow</a> even white supremacist David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan.</p>

<p>At least, Mr Trump does not hold back and directly confronts you with his
prejudices. Hence he told members of the <a
href="https://blogs.reuters.com/talesfromthetrail/2015/12/03/trump-to-jewish-donors-i-dont-want-your-money/">Republican
Jewish Coalition</a> that <q>you’re not going to support me because I don’t want
your money.</q> Moments later, he followed with the ingratiating boast, <q>I’m a
negotiator like you folks, we are negotiators.</q> Amazingly, the group <a
href="https://forward.com/news/351983/fuming-behind-the-scenes-the-republican-jewish-coalition-effectively-dumps/">still
endorsed him</a>, if only tepidly. Hence he <a
href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/donald-trump-african-american-voters/">addressed
black voters</a>, in front of a mostly white audience to boot, with this
uplifting message: <q>You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you
have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed—what the hell do you have to
lose?</q> The quote likely reflects Mr Trump’s stereotypical views of black
life. It may also reflect the Rust Belt location of his speech. But it certainly
captures the president-elect’s nihilist message and appeal! Tragically, this
divisive approach to campaigning delivered clear results, with voters’ racism
and sexism <a
href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/4/14160956/trump-racism-sexism-economy-study">being
far stronger predictors</a> for a Trump vote than economic dissatisfaction.
Worse, the president-elect’s very visible division of the population into
favored and non-favored groups will not end with the election. It cannot be
undone. Rather, it is bound to seep into the new administration, encouraging
similar though less overt biases when it comes to the allocation of government
resources and thereby making the systematic violence and neglect of cities like
<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2014/11/27/the-fury-of-ferguson">Ferguson</a>
and <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2016/01/23/that-flinty-taste">Flint</a>
more likely again. And by unleashing bigotry and prejudice in service of
electoral victory and personal enrichment, Mr Trump has failed all of us!</p>

<p>We are on the brink of a new, darker age, with nationalism on the rise again
across the western world. But nationalism never has and never will solve
anything. It is a scourge of civilization, and we seemingly have forgotten its
destructive effects. Yet the scars are still there, for all of us to see if only
we look close enough. My grandfather was a kind and unassuming man, who deeply
cared and studiously provided for his family. But there were two holes in his
life, for he had the great misfortune to be old enough to be drafted during
World War <span class=roman>I</span> and young enough to be drafted again during
World War <span class=roman>II</span>. He never talked about his experience,
neither to his children nor to his grandchildren. Silence loudly announced the
burden, yet the burden was his alone to bear. Still, my grandfather could find
consolation in seeing his children and grandchildren grow up in a more peaceful
and prosperous world, thanks to increasing international collaboration and
integration. Striving towards the free movement of goods, people, and ideas
remains the most effective engine for <a
href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2016/10/01/why-theyre-wrong">reducing
poverty</a> and <a
href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2016/10/08/the-way-ahead">increasing
opportunity</a> across the world. We urgently need more of it, not less. At the
same time, this election brings home what long should have been apparent:
Globalization must be tempered by social responsibility. Otherwise, the
resulting, unbridled inequality is as toxic to society as the nationalism of
yore. I certainly am glad that my grandfather does not have to bear the burden
of this lesson as well! </p>

<p>In Alfred Jarry’s <cite lang=fr translate=no>Ubu Roi</cite>, or <cite>Ubu the
King</cite>, the titular character spends much of the play leading a revolution
in Poland, destroying the country, and killing her population. Yet in the final
scene, we find the proponent sitting on the deck of a cruise ship, having a good
laugh with his wife and part-time opponent about havoc just wrecked and looking
forward to throwing an unsuspecting France into the same maelstrom. The original
run lasted just <time datetime=1896-12-10>one December evening in 1896</time>
thanks to its riotous audience reception. Yet the play remains part of the
proto-modernist canon. It took 120 years for reality to catch up with fiction.
But with Mr Trump we are witnessing the ascendency of a true political leader,
who has an uncanny ability to shape the conversation by alternating ease and
force and by channeling a sardonic wit. But he also has little discernible inner
life, is unbound by truth or decency, doesn’t even have the patina of ideology,
and harms or discards people like playthings. Welcome to the first nihilist
president of the United States. Or rather: <em>To hell with him!</em></p>
