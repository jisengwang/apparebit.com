<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>The name <dfn lang=la translate=no>Apparebit</dfn> is the third-person
singular future active indicative of the Latin verb <i lang=la
translate=no>appareo</i> and translates to “it will appear.” It also is
programmatic: I created this website around <time>2010</time> as a showcase for
my photography. I then shifted the focus towards my writing in
<time>2019</time>. I still hope to integrate my creative, technical, and
scholarly output on this website — eventually.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=history>
<h2 id=history>History</h2>

<p>So far, Apparebit has been through three major versions:</p>

<ol class=drop-count>
<li>The first version of Apparebit featured a rotating cast of photographs under
a couple of headings and was utterly brutalist long before brutalist design
became fashionable. It also fell short on information architecture, semantic
markup, responsiveness, and accessibility. It did, however, feature a deliberate
choice of typeface, Helvetica, an hitherto unacknowledged nod towards my first
conscious use of a typeface, <a
href="https://www.bertholdtypes.com/font/ag-book/proplus/">Akzidenz-Grotesk
Buch</a>, for a series of posters promoting gay dance parties in my hometown
Würzburg during the late 1980s.</li>

<li>The second version, released in <time datetime=2012-04>April 2012</time>,
was rather <em>serious</em>, presenting my photography as art. Around the time,
I did indeed participate in a couple of group shows and also won an award for my
work. Whereas the first version fell short on best practices, the second version
made up for it and then some. It was semantic, accessible, and most definitely
responsive—with supported browsers ranging from Internet Explorer on the desktop
down to dedicated web views after smartphone installation. Alas, the visual
design itself was bland and utilitarian despite overindulging in subtle light
gradients and shadows. I removed these visual embellishments <time
datetime=2015-08>three years later</time>, resulting in a design that was bland,
utilitarian, and flat. Huzzah!</li>

<li>Starting in <time>2015</time>, I was increasingly using Facebook as a <i
lang=la translate=no>de facto</i> blog. But I was also becoming increasingly
concerned about that highly toxic platform. The resulting effort towards a new
design and new tooling was too ambitious at first. It still yielded considerable
insight into architecture, visual appearance, typography, and workflows. But it
never quite yielded usable tools or a new website. While working on a one-page
side project, I realized that the difference between that self-contained page
and a minimum viable Apparebit had shrunk to a couple of weeks of work and went
for it. I launched the third version of Apparebit in <time
datetime=2019-08-20>late August 2019</time> and made <a
href="https://github.com/apparebit/apparebit.com">the source repository</a>
public in <time datetime=2019-09-11>early September 2019</time>.</li>
</ol>

<p>At launch, Apparebit’s third version relied on a number of quick and dirty
Node.js scripts. Those scripts subsequently became the core of the <a
href="https://github.com/apparebit/siteforge">site:forge</a> static website
generator. I justify the tool’s existence by a somewhat unique design that
eschews conventional niche languages for styling and templating and embraces
view components written in JavaScript only for website-generation-time. Since
that is a much simpler problem than interactive client interfaces, the view
component runtime also is much simpler. It helps that site:forge meets my needs
consistently and surprisingly well.</p>

<h2 id=typography>Typography</h2>

<p>Apparebit’s current design features typefaces by contemporary designers from
Argentina, France, and the United States. Body text throughout this website is
set in <a href="https://www.type-together.com/bely-font">Bely</a> designed by <a
href="http://www.roxanegataud.com">Roxane Gataud</a> and available through
<a href="https://www.type-together.com">TypeTogether</a>. The website’s logo and
several pages’ headings use the rather distinctive Bely Display. Depending on
content, headings on other pages may instead use one of the following
typefaces:</p>

<ul class=tight>
<li><a href="https://djr.com/notes/bild-widths-font-of-the-month/">Bild</a>
designed by <a href="https://djr.com/about/">David Jonathan Ross</a> and
released through his <a href="https://fontofthemonth.club">Font of the Month
Club</a>;</li>

<li><a href="http://phantom-foundry.com/project/bluu-suuperstar">Bluu
Suuperstar</a>
designed by <a href="http://phantom-foundry.com">Jean-Baptiste Morizot</a> and
released through
<a href="https://black-foundry.com">Black Foundry</a>;</li>

<li><a href="https://pampatype.com/reforma">Reforma 2018</a>
designed by <a rel=noreferrer
href="https://twitter.com/alelocelso?lang=en">Alejandro Lo Celso</a> and
released under the <a
href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">Creative Commons
<abbr>BY-ND</abbr> 4.0</a> license.</li>
</ul>

<p>FutureFonts and Ross’ Font of the Month Club are great resources for new type
designs. Their typefaces may not always have the same selection of glyphs,
OpenType features, or weights as those offered by more conventional, industrial
foundries. They may also be very much in-progress. At the same time, they always
are interesting and fresh. From an economic perspective, FutureFonts and the
Font of the Month Club benefit users through often lower price points, while
also providing independent type designers with some measure of a steady income.
It’s a win-win for all parties involved!</p>
