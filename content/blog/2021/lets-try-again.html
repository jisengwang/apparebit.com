<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>Not surprisingly, Amazon’s <abbr>AWS</abbr> enforces rate limits on their
services. Their client libraries also incorporate automatic retries. They may
allow an application to gracefully recover after exceeding those rate limits.
But under heavy data volumes and with the <abbr>AWS</abbr> default retry
strategy, a process can still trigger rate limits and fail despite
retrying.</p>

<p>In this article, we will:</p>

<ul class=tight>
<li>Review the basics of retries as a failure handling strategy.</li>
<li>Explain the above interaction with rate limits and its solution illustrated
by Python source code.</li>
<li>Explore several other technical properties of effective retries.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ --> <hr> <!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

<p>Our journey begins a couple of months ago, when one of our data processing
pipelines failed because <abbr>AWS</abbr> returned a <samp>503 Slow Down</samp>
error. After inspecting our logs and consulting Amazon’s documentation, my team
determined that a bulk copy between two S3 buckets exceeded Amazon’s rate
limits.</p>

<p>At this point, I was already implementing retries in my head, a challenge
familiar from previous employers and projects. After all, retries — executing
the same operation with the same arguments again, possibly after a short delay —
are simple and sufficient for overcoming many (but not all) failures.</p>

<p>In fact, we constantly use retries in our everyday lives: think about asking
somebody to repeat what they just said because face masks make it harder to
understand people or swiping a credit or subway card again (and again) when the
first swipe didn’t register.</p>

<p>After digging a little deeper into Amazon’s documentation, it turned out that
all <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/s3-optimizing-performance-best-practices/timeouts-and-retries-for-latency-sensitive-applications.html">their
client libraries already implement retries</a> and automatically employ them
when appropriate — so much for me implementing retries again. Under the default
settings of boto3,
<a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3">the Python client for
<abbr>AWS</abbr></a>, our pipeline stage didn’t just fail once but failed five
times on the same copy operation. Maybe retries aren’t so simple after all.</p>

<p>Recent changes to <abbr>AWS</abbr>’ implementation of retries suggest that
<abbr>AWS</abbr> engineers might just share that sentiment. In February 2020,
boto3 demoted the previous retry mode to “legacy” status (though it still is the
default) and gained two new modes called “standard” and “adaptive”. As it turns
out, the latter solves our problem. But the technical reasons aren’t intuitively
obvious.</p>

<p>This blog post starts out by explaining the basics of when to use retries. We
then explore their interaction with rate limits and show the Python code for
configuring boto3 to gracefully handle that case. Along the way, I’ll explain
several other technical aspects of rate limits and retries. By the end of the
article, you’ll have a solid understanding of both rate limits and retries that
you can apply to your own work.</p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby=only-try>
<h2 id=only-try>Only Try Retries When…</h2>

<p>Retries differ from other techniques for providing fault tolerance such as <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications">data
replication</a> or <a href="https://raft.github.io/">distributed consensus</a>
in that they are strikingly simple: just do it — again! As a result, we don’t
need to go through complex algorithms for retries themselves (yay!). But we do
need to review the three primary criteria for when we can use retries.</p>


<h3>Operations Are Idempotent</h3>

<p>Fundamentally, retrying is only safe if an operation is idempotent, i.e.,
repeated execution results in the exact same outcomes or state. If you were to
retry</p>

<pre><code class=language-python>transfer_money_from_me_to(
    recipient,
    amount,
)
</code></pre>

<p>and your bank’s <abbr>API</abbr> timed out, retrying would be ok if your
request was dropped by the load balancer in your bank’s frontend but not so much
if the confirmation was lost in the tangle of your bank’s microservices. The
problem is that you couldn’t tell a-priori and retrying this particular
operation might just drain your account of all its funds. To put this
differently, <em>retrying is safe if and only if doing so eventually converges
on the same global system state</em>.</p>

<p>Conveniently, the protocol enabling the web, <abbr>HTTP</abbr>, was
explicitly designed with retries in mind. They are part of the representational
state transfer or <a
href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm"><abbr>REST</abbr>
model</a> underlying the web. In particular, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>GET</code>,
<code>HEAD</code>, and <code>PUT</code> are idempotent. <code>GET</code> and
<code>HEAD</code> also are read-only. Only <code>POST</code> is not idempotent
and thus not safe to retry. So when designing a <abbr>REST</abbr>
<abbr>API</abbr>, you probably want to minimize the use of <code>POST</code>.
Sure enough, <abbr>AWS</abbr> does just that. They expose their cloud services
through a <abbr>REST</abbr> <abbr>API</abbr> and, out of 96 endpoints in the <a
href="https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/develop/botocore/data/s3/2006-03-01/service-2.json">service
description for S3</a>, only six use <code>POST</code>.</p>

<p>The central role of retries for recovering from failures on the web is seen
in browsers and services alike. Notably, it explains why browsers have a reload
button in the first place. It also explains why most websites warn us not to use
the reload button during payment processing, which typically is implemented as a
<code>POST</code>. Finally, it explains why eventual consistency is the dominant
consistency model across the web. After all, that’s just what we get when
combining idempotent operations with retries and also the reason I already used
similar language in the above definition of safe retries.</p>

<p>That’s all well and good. But what should we do about operations like the
above endpoint to transfer money? To find a solution, it helps to ask how we
distinguish seemingly indistinguishable events, such as birthdays or rent
payments, as well as fungible packaged goods, such as cereal boxes and milk
cartons. The answer is straightforward: We add another attribute based on
date/time or a monotonically increasing counter. That certainly works for the
above endpoint as well:</p>

<pre><code class=language-python>transfer_money_from_me_to(
    recipient,
    amount,
    transaction_id,
)
</code></pre>

<p>The bank doesn’t know how a client generates such a transaction
<abbr>ID</abbr>. That is entirely up to each individual client. But the bank
does commit to performing only one transfer, even if several requests with the
same transaction <abbr>ID</abbr> are submitted to the endpoint. It may also want
to reject any request that shares a transaction <abbr>ID</abbr> with a previous
request but differs in recipient or amount. This pattern can be found in many
<abbr>REST</abbr> <abbr>API</abbr>s. The corresponding operations may be named
<code>create_or_get_something</code>.</p>


<h3>Failures Are Transient</h3>

<p>Even if it is safe to retry an operation, that doesn’t necessarily mean we
should actually retry the operation. We also have to consider the nature of the
failure. For an example, let’s consider our favorite banking endpoint again. If
the bank returns an error indicating insufficient funds, retrying will only have
the same result. The bank won’t transfer non-existent funds no matter how often
(or nicely) we ask. We first need to transfer funds <em>into</em> the account or
open a line of credit.</p>

<p>However, if the request times out, we don’t know the outcome of the request
and should definitely try again. In short, retrying only makes sense if the
failure is non-deterministic or transient. While it is safe to retry on any
error, doing so for deterministic errors is pointless and only wastes
resources.</p>

<p>Effective retries thus depend on the error reporting mechanism as well as the
error classification policy. As far as mechanism is concerned, both server and
client need to capture the concrete causes of failures and faithfully forward
fine-grained error information. Whether an implementation uses error codes or
exception types doesn’t really matter, but it is critical that higher layers do
<em>not</em> mask the error information captured by lower layers.</p>

<p>As far as policy is concerned, engineers need to inventory the specific
errors occurring in a system and then classify them as retryable or not. A
mechanized version of that classifier forms the core of the retry logic.</p>

<p>Judging by boto3’s code repositories and commit histories <a
href="https://github.com/boto">on Github</a>, <abbr>AWS</abbr> engineers
significantly deepened their understanding of both retry policy and mechanism
over the years. The original version in boto3’s runtime botocore implements the
so-called <em>legacy</em> mode. It dates back to April 2013 and comprises one
module with 360 lines of well-documented Python code.</p>

<p>In contrast, the new version from February 2020 implements both the
<em>standard</em> and <em>adaptive</em> modes. It comprises seven modules with
920 lines of well-documented Python code. The primary difference between legacy
and standard modes is that the latter classifies many more errors as retryable
and thus covers many more endpoints. At the same time, the standard mode also
enforces a quota on active retries, thus protecting the client from being
overwhelmed by retries in case of, say, a network or <abbr>AWS</abbr> outage
(which are rare <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet">but
do happen</a>).</p>


<aside class=sidebar>
<h3>Systems Archeology I</h3>

<p>I suspect that <abbr>AWS</abbr> engineers started out with retry logic even
simpler than what is offered by the legacy mode. When a client exceeds rate
limits, S3 returns a 503 <abbr>HTTP</abbr> status code with a non-standard
reason <samp>503 Slow Down</samp>. That’s a curious choice of status code
because the 5xx status codes indicate server errors, whereas exceeding rate
limits are client errors, as indicated by a 4xx status code in
<abbr>HTTP</abbr>. Furthermore, <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6585"><abbr>RFC</abbr> 6585</a>
defines a directly suitable alternative, <samp>429 Too Many Requests</samp>. The
standard definition of the 503 status code, <samp>503 Service
Unavailable</samp>, suggests the reason for this non-standard choice by Amazon
engineers: That status code is commonly used when a server is overloaded, an
obviously retryable error condition. Hence I wouldn’t be surprised if earlier
versions of <abbr>AWS</abbr> client libraries simply retried on 503 only and
this was an expedient solution to increasing the reach of the retry logic.</p>
</aside>


<h3>Success Is Likely</h3>

<p>In the introduction to this section, I breezed through one last major concern
when I wrote “just do it — again,” leaving the timing entirely open. While the
previous two subsections didn’t mention timing, we nonetheless made one
important observation:retrying when the likely outcome is another failure wastes
resources. If we extrapolate from that, retrying in short succession over and
over again is equally pointless.</p>

<p>Real world experience with children during long car journeys underlines that
point. Pestering the parents by retrying incessant “Are we there yet?” chants
does not bring the destination any closer. It may even unnerve the parents to
the point of a forced hour-long break, thus delaying arrival. At least, that’s
how my parents describe past car trips for summer vacation.</p>

<p>The uncomfortable truth is that, in distributed systems, sending too many
retries is fundamentally indistinguishable from a denial of service attack.
Experienced service providers on the internet do not take kindly to such
attacks. Instead they implement drastic countermeasures, up to and including
dropping all requests originating from a suspect <abbr>IP</abbr> address in the
firewall, before the request even gets to any application server. To avoid that,
we need to pace ourselves when retrying. Best practice is to <em>delay</em>
each retry, use <em>exponential backoff</em> for repeated retries, and to add
some degree of variability by introducing <em>randomized jitter</em>.</p>

<p>In my experience, jitter is typically computed <a
href="https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/exponential-backoff">as a
smallish delta</a> on top of the deterministic exponential delay. Reading the
source code for botocore, I discovered that it instead randomly scales the
deterministic exponential delay between zero and the full value. I was surprised
by that choice. As it turns out, <abbr>AWS</abbr> engineers carefully considered
the interaction between exponential backoff and jitter, simulating several
approaches, and found that “full jitter” was the most effective choice. Amazon’s
Marc Brooker <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/">wrote
a great blog post</a> about just that.</p>

<p><i>Are we there yet? — No!</i></p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby=limiting-the-rate-of-tries>
<h2 id=limiting-the-rate-of-tries>Limiting the Rate of Tries and Retries</h2>

<p>So far, we only considered retrying individual operations in isolation. In
such cases, the above three criteria are sufficient for determining when and how
to use retries. But when operations occur repeatedly, at more or less regular
intervals, and loosely depend on each other, the three criteria aren’t
sufficient anymore.</p>

<p>Probably the loosest such dependency are rate limits, which do not impose any
ordering constraints but do limit the overall number of operations per time
period. They are critical for ensuring that a few overly aggressive or even
malicious clients cannot overwhelm resources shared amongst many more clients.
For that reason, they are pervasive across cloud services.</p>

<p>While it is possible to trigger rate limits reliably and predictably by
sending a sufficiently high volume of requests per time period for long enough,
triggering rate limits for a particular request is exceedingly hard if not
impossible. That’s good news: we can treat rate limit violations as
non-deterministic errors that are subject to retries (of course, only if the
operation also is idempotent). But retrying the failed operation does not
suffice for making sustained progress. Instead, the rate limit violation serves
as a signal that subsequent future operations are not currently welcome either —
within some time period.</p>

<p><i>Are we there yet? — No!</i></p>


<h3>The Token Bucket Algorithm</h3>

<p>That time period is typically determined by the algorithm used for enforcing
rate limits, with the default choice being <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket">the token bucket
algorithm</a>. It is simple enough to describe in a paragraph:</p>

<p>The name stems from the main data structure, a bucket holding fungible
tokens, i.e., a counter. The server maintains a bucket per client and
periodically adds a fixed amount of tokens into each bucket, up to some upper
limit corresponding to the rate limit. When the server receives a request, it
attempts to remove one or more tokens from the client’s bucket, with the amount
corresponding to the effort necessary for servicing the request. If there are
sufficient tokens in the bucket, the server removes them and completes the
request. If there aren’t, it rejects the request with a rate limit
violation.</p>

<p><i>Are we there yet? — Now we are!</i></p>


<h3>How Our Pipeline Failed</h3>

<p>Now we have enough context to explain the exact circumstances leading to the
failure of our data processing pipeline. As mentioned in the introduction, the
pipeline failed during a bulk copy between two S3 volumes. The data being copied
is a very large dataset in <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Parquet’s columnar
format</a>, which puts (parts of) columns into their own files organized by
directories to represent tables.</p>

<p>Many of these directories contain many thousands of files. The particular
directory that triggered the rate limit failure contained 4,003 files. At the
same time, <abbr>AWS</abbr> limits clients to 3,500 <code>DELETE</code>,
<code>POST</code>, or <code>PUT</code> requests and 5,000 <code>GET</code> or
<code>HEAD</code> requests per second per prefix in a bucket. (“Object,”
“prefix,” and “bucket” are official S3 lingo. I’m using “file,” “directory,” and
“volume” interchangeably.) There are no limits on the number of prefixes in a
bucket.</p>

<p>Since the bulk copy is implemented by copying individual objects and
initiates those operations in a tight loop, it can easily exceed the above rate
limits. Furthermore, since boto3’s retry logic uses full jitter, i.e.,
randomizes the delay between 0 and the exponentially increasing duration, the
retry may occur pretty much immediately after the failure, i.e., with a delay
much smaller than the period <abbr>AWS</abbr> uses to track S3 rate limits.</p>

<p>But that means that the retry will exceed the same already exceeded rate
limit and fail again. While the probability of the retry delay being much
smaller than the rate limit period is small and getting smaller as the number of
retries increases, the number of copies is sufficiently large so that this event
may happen five times in a row. At that point, boto3’s legacy retry mode stops
retrying and fails the copy operation. That in turn fails our pipeline.</p>


<aside class=sidebar>
<h3>Systems Archeology II</h3>

<p>In the first systems archeology above, I took note of an unusual choice of
<abbr>HTTP</abbr> status code to speculate about earlier retry logic and an
expedient engineering decision by <abbr>AWS</abbr> engineers. This time, I am
basing my speculation on a note in the official documentation for S3. The
section on “<a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance.html">Optimizing
Amazon S3 performance</a>” states: “You no longer have to randomize prefix
naming for performance.” If users had to randomize prefixes before, that implies
that <abbr>AWS</abbr> was partitioning the data stored in buckets by some prefix
of the prefix or directory name.</p>

<p>Nowadays, however, <abbr>AWS</abbr> can partition data at the granularity of
a single prefix / directory name. Since it supports more flexible naming
schemes, that certainly is a boon for users. At the same time, partitioning at
such fine granularity must result in a massive maintenance state within S3’s
implementation. I suspect it is just for that reason that the same documentation
section <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/optimizing-performance-design-patterns.html#optimizing-performance-timeouts-retries">later
states</a>: “Amazon S3 automatically scales in response to sustained new request
rates, dynamically optimizing performance.” In other words, S3 will partition a
bucket by individual prefix, but only if necessary for a given access pattern.
That is an impressive engineering achievement!</p>
</aside>


<h3>Fixing Our Pipeline</h3>

<p>Conveniently, the carefully staged explanation of how exactly our pipeline
failed also describes everything we need for avoiding just that kind of failure.
Even more conveniently, <abbr>AWS</abbr> engineers already implemented the
solution and then some — through the <i>adaptive</i> retry mode. The solution is
based on the realization that, for bulk operations that exceed rate limits, it
isn’t sufficient to retry the failing request. Instead we need to slow down the
entire bulk operation and <i>throttle</i> any future requests, i.e., issue them
at a slower rate.</p>

<p>We already know how to do that: use the token bucket algorithm! The only
difference when using the algorithm on the client for throttling is that we
don’t fail requests when there aren’t enough tokens in the bucket, but rather we
wait until there are enough tokens. That’s just what boto3’s adaptive retry mode
does. Well, with one significant additional feature: Instead of requiring that
user code configures the maximum request rate, the adaptive retry mode
automatically adjusts the maximum capacity of the bucket based on successful as
well as unsuccessful outcomes.</p>

<p>I’m sure you are as excited as I was when I discovered the retry mode and are
itching to enable it for your own Python-based data processing pipelines.
Thankfully, it doesn’t take much: All you need to do is pass an appropriate
configuration object to boto3’s <code>client()</code> or <code>resource()</code>
function via the <code>config</code> named argument. The only slightly tricky
part is that you need to use botocore’s configuration object.</p>

<figure>
<pre><code class=language-python>import boto3
from botocore.config import Config

# Access S3 with adaptive retries:
ADAPTIVE_RETRIES = Config(retries={
    # 1 try and up to 3 retries:
    "total_max_attempts": 4,
    "mode": "adaptive",
})
s3 = boto3.resource(
    "s3",
    config=ADAPTIVE_RETRIES
)

# Test: Can we break camel’s back?
bucket = s3.create("camel")
for index in range(0, 10000):
    straw = f"straw #{index}"
    bucket.upload_fileobj(
        straw.encode("utf8"), straw
    )
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Code example for configuring boto3 to use adaptive retry
mode</figcaption>
</figure>


<h3>Beyond AWS</h3>

<p>I apologize if the code example seems underwhelming. <abbr>AWS</abbr>
engineers did all of the hard work here already, we just need to enable it.
However, if you are looking for a coding challenge, consider what it would take
to provide similar functionality for another cloud service. A likely source of
frustration is the need for implementing similar algorithms for retries and rate
limits for the server as well as the client libraries in every language.</p>

<p>In fact, that’s already happening for <abbr>AWS</abbr>. Several of the client
libraries for other programming languages as well as the Android and iOS
<abbr>SDK</abbr>s support automatic retries for authentication errors <a
href="https://altereos.com/how-to-correct-clock-skew-in-aws/">caused by clock
skew</a>. However, boto3 does not. The <a
href="https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/1252">corresponding issue</a> has
been open for four years now.</p>

<p>That raises the question if we can do better. My answer is an emphatic
“possibly maybe.” I base that decisive assessment on the observation that
exponential backoff with jitter and the token bucket algorithm are both
techniques for best guessing an appropriate delay for retries based solely on
whether requests succeeded or failed. Yet the server generating these responses
knows quite a bit more. Since it enforces rate limits, it knows their basic
configuration and it knows their client-specific state.</p>

<p>Hence the above question becomes: If we expose some of that server knowledge
to clients, can we dispense with token buckets? My answer remains an emphatic
“possibly maybe.” <abbr>HTTP</abbr> already includes the
<code>Retry-After</code> header to provide a hint for the retry delay and <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-00.html">an
<abbr>IETF</abbr> draft</a> standardizes several more headers that expose
even more information.</p>

<p>But the <code>Retry-After</code> header applies only to a single operation
and thus becomes meaningless under sustained load, much like exponential backoff
is insufficient under sustained load. <a
href="https://www.useanvil.com/blog/engineering/throttling-and-consuming-apis-with-429-rate-limits/">Ben
Ogle wrote a blog post</a> exploring just that question and ended up showing
that the token bucket algorithm works real well. But that outcome also was
predictable because he applied the
<code>Retry-After</code> header only to the next retry for that request. In
short, the question of whether we can design a more general header remains
open.</p>

<section aria-labelledby=conclusion>
<h2 id=conclusion>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>We explored retries as a simple and effective fault tolerance
mechanism in significant detail. While retries apply to many cases, they aren’t
applicable in general. First, retries are only safe for idempotent operations.
Second, they can only change the outcome upon non-deterministic failures, which
include transient, rate-limit, and time-skew errors. Third, retries must be
delayed, typically through exponential backoff with randomized jitter, to avoid
denial-of-service attacks.</p>

<p>When operations occur at regular intervals, retrying individual operations
isn’t enough. Instead, we may have to throttle the request rate across all
operations. This blog post used <abbr>AWS</abbr> and its client library for
Python as running examples. Notably, it included source code for configuring
throttled operation. But the techniques described in this blog post are general
and supported <a
href="https://medium.com/@juliozynger/be-a-good-client-jitter-19714ced379">by
many other client libraries</a>. Now that you understand all the necessary
background, it is your turn to try retries — or to retry them again!</p>

<p>At the same time, the single most important take-away from this blog post is
not the particulars of retries, rate limits, and <abbr>AWS</abbr>’ exemplary
support for them but rather an understanding that handling failure in
distributed systems is genuinely hard — you are about to finish a 3,900 word
article about “doing it again” — and critically depends on the exact semantics
of error conditions. To put that differently, getting the normal code path
working is easy. That’s also when the real engineering work starts!</p>
