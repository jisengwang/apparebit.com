<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>When Jack Dorsey, the <abbr>CEO</abbr> of Twitter, permanently deplatformed
then president Donald Trump on January 8, he did the United States as well as
the rest of the world a tremendous favor. Over the following week, the spread of
<a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/16/misinformation-trump-twitter/">election
misinformation plummeted an impressive 73%</a>.
While certainly startling, this statistic is entirely consistent with another,
earlier study that pointed to <a
href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/519226-study-finds-trump-was-the-largest-driver-of-the-covid-19">Trump
as the likely largest driver of Covid-19 misinformation</a> during the early
months of the pandemic across the <em>entire</em> English-speaking world. With
Trump effectively silenced, Biden’s inauguration on January 20 was a non-event,
even at state capitols. It was marred only by dubious musical programming, whose
most bizarre and least terrible moment was Lady Gaga impersonating Heidi at the
Hunger Games while belting out the national anthem. In short, “Twitter and
Facebook just proved that deplatforming works” (headline at <a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/twitter-facebook-free-speech/">The
Nation</a>).</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=waning-power>
<h2 id=waning-power>The Waning Power of Donald Trump</h2>

<p>A critical but under-appreciated reason for Trump’s deplatforming being so
effective is his embrace of a performative macho masculinity. Trump has
surrounded himself in office with (former) generals, directly appealed to law
enforcement types, and made his mentor Roy Cohn’s attack-first style his own. He
even staged a Soviet-style military parade, nominally on occasion of July 4, but
it really was all about Trump, Trump, and Trump. His hurrah-patriotic law and
order rhetoric has certainly fooled many, who took it at face value. But a
careful observer is bound to notice that, when not making noise, Trump is an
incredibly lazy and cowardly man. He has no substance whatsoever and always
makes others do his dirty work. Sure enough, on January 6, he told
insurrectionists he would join them in their attack on the Capitol—only to hide
in his room at the White House and yell at the <abbr>TV</abbr>. Dorsey closing
Trump’s Twitter account stripped him of his most effective way of making noise
and some of Trump’s more sophisticated followers, the Proud Boys, soon
thereafter noticed, publicly labelling him a “<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/technology/proud-boys-trump.html">total
failure</a>” while permanently disavowing him as well.</p>

<p>Comparing a man’s power to his sexual prowess usually is a rather tedious
exercise that only serves to reinforce hegemonic gender norms. The thing is: In
this specific instance, it is not only justified but the very cringing it
induces is instructive in that it mirrors the emasculation Trump received in the
eyes of his devoted followers. Dorsey’s deplatforming decision then rendered
Trump entirely impotent, with no digital viagra in sight, and the effect was so
immediate and so total to suggest actual dismemberment. If you think that’s a
bit much, I point to Senate Majority Speaker Chuck Schumer who seems to have
harbored similar thoughts when he misspoke on the floor of the Senate, at first
<a rel=noreferrer
href="https://twitter.com/jamieson/status/1352636240504479744?s=20">replacing
“insurrection” with “erection”</a> before correcting himself.</p>

</section>
<section aria-labelledby=rising-power>
<h2 id=rising-power>The Rising Power of Twitter and Facebook</h2>

<p>To be sure, Trump’s permanent deplatforming from Twitter was an astonishing
display of power. Only weeks ago, most people would not have wagered on the male
<abbr>CEO</abbr> of an also-ran social network winning a power struggle with the
so-called leader of the free world that would render the latter ineffective—for
the moment. It doesn’t help that the former only has a tenuous grasp on his
<abbr>CEO</abbr> position, which he gained by out-maneuvering the firm’s two
co-founders and already lost once before. Furthermore, he is genuinely weird,
with an appearance closer to a monk or Taliban than a billionaire and eating
habits (once a day during the week, none on weekends) that point to body image
issues more typically associated with teenage girls. Finally and most
surprisingly, in this one instance, <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/how-facebook-twitter-decided-take-down-trump-s-accounts-n1254317">Twitter
acted slower than Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>That is surprising because the latter firm’s <abbr>CEO</abbr>, Mark
Zuckerberg, has neither the technical nor moral heft of Dorsey. He clings to his
position only thanks to shares that inflate his voting rights in the yearly
shareholder conference, where the majority of shareholders who aren’t Zuckerberg
reliably vote against him. Given his limited abilities and ethics, Zuckerberg,
who despite being a Jew even prevaricates about Holocaust denial, has a tendency
to rope in others as foils for his platform’s abysmal record. Sure enough, his
decision to deplatform Trump has been only temporary and the actual decision is
now <a
href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/236821561313092-oversight-board-accepts-case-on-former-us-president-trump-s-indefinite-suspension-from-facebook-and-instagram/">left
to the so-called oversight board</a>. Then again, maybe Zuckerberg’s very public
indecisiveness when it comes these issues is the more savvy public relations
strategy because it gives all stakeholders the illusion of possibly swaying his
mind. Dorsey hinted at similar considerations when pointing out a week later
that <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/14/956664893/twitter-ceo-tweets-about-banning-trump-from-site">he
worries about the precedent</a> he just set.</p>

<p>In either case, Facebook’s oversight board must be the most elaborate and
expensive Potemkin village ever created. It is staffed with highly visible
academics and politicians. It also is well funded, thanks to a foundation
financed by a generous donation from Facebook. But its much vaunted independence
is a blatant lie, since Facebook has a nearly absolute veto right on cases the
board considers and can always withdraw from the process without any financial
consequences. In other words, Facebook can continue with business as usual.
Sadly, those of us who are technically savvy and thus should know better often
don’t hold Facebook leadership accountable, not even outside the public’s eye.
When Turing award winner and Facebook’s Chief <abbr>AI</abbr> Scientist Yann
LeCun made a highly self-serving and misleading <a rel=noreferrer
href="https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10157436912982143">post on
Facebook about Facebook on January 20</a>, it received almost 200 likes and the
vast majority of the 67 comments (two of which are mine) were approving. Maybe
three people besides me pointed out the deep flaws in his reasoning and called
him on it.</p>

</section>
<section aria-labelledby=one-down>
<h2 id=one-down>One Down, Two More to Go</h2>

<p>While <abbr>US</abbr> Republicans weren’t too pleased about this
deplatforming, the <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/merkel-sees-closing-trump-s-social-media-accounts-problematic">far
more credible protest</a> came from people who aren’t also craven
insurrectionists, namely the French and German governments. However, the
arguments made by Republicans, the French, and also assorted tech bros reduce to
tiresome posturing about free speech. It’s curious that they remember free
speech only when a straight white man is censored but not while that same man
has been inciting odious prejudices and hatred while also spreading insidious
lies, which all are key ingredients to fascism. They thus ignore one of two
critical lessons from the United States’s four-year devolution towards the same
under Trump: These aren’t just impolite outbursts on Twitter that can be
compartmentalized away. There is no such thing as a little fascism that is safe
to consume. (The other lesson is that fascism is utterly exhausting because the
leader does not do any governing in the conventional sense but is busy staging
drama all day and night.)</p>

<p>In contrast, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, raises a more direct and
more effective objection, namely that it is unbecoming for an industry
<abbr>CEO</abbr> to have that much power over a then sitting <abbr>US</abbr>
president. She is right. She also is rather late coming to this realization,
seeing that there have been ample warnings about the awesome power of Facebook
and Twitter. That is particularly disappointing because Merkel, unlike most of
us, actually has the power to do something about it. But like most people across
the western world, she seemingly ignored the problem while the worst of negative
externalities—genocide in Myanmar, genocide in Ethiopia, sectarian strife in Sri
Lanka, and so on—were accumulating in far off countries. As <a
href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo">the
2020 memo by a data scientist fired from Facebook</a> makes ample clear, these
are not exceptions but the norm. Twitter doesn’t figure prominently in these
externalities simply because it is too irrelevant. It nonetheless deserves the
same scrutiny because of its unique role as favored hangout of news
reporters.</p>

<p>In summary then, Dorsey, Trump, and Zuckerberg are all three clear and
present threats to freedom, democracy, and human rights the world over. That two
of them are unelected technology industry executives makes them rather more
illegitimate than Trump, who at least was elected once in 2016. But it also
makes them far more dangerous in the long term because the very organizations
they head are equal threats to freedom, democracy, and human rights and
consequently neutering the four social networks operated by the two firms will
be much harder than replacing the <abbr>US</abbr> president and his political
appointees. As it happens, the executives have taken out the by now former
president. It would be singularly foolish to restore the platform of the former
president. Instead we should focus on neutralizing the threat posed by Facebook
and Twitter. Using antitrust law to split the former into its constituent parts
should only be the beginning. I’m pretty certain we can get <abbr>US</abbr>
Republicans to rally behind that cause. What about you so-called liberals? Are
you willing to form a strategic alliance towards that goal? I certainly am.</p>
