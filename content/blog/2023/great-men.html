<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>Walter Isaacson's biography of Elon Musk, the richest man on Earth, hit
bookstores <time datetime=2023-09-12>in September 2023</time> and the publicity
campaign for the book is in full swing. Many of the remaining bastions of
establishment journalism including the <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-twitter-x-takeover-walter-isaacson-5f553fa"><cite>Wall
Street Journal</cite></a>, the <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/09/07/elon-musk-starlink-ukraine-russia-invasion/">Washington
<cite>Post</cite></a>, and <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/09/ai-for-cars-walter-isaacson-biography-of-elon-musk-excerpt.html"><abbr>CNBC</abbr></a>
published excerpts from the book. Brasher but not any less established <a
href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/walter-isaacson-elon-musk-biography.html"><cite>New
York</cite> Magazine</a> published a profile of the author. Isaacson’s
publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, certainly knows how to sell books. It probably
helped that Isaacson’s past gigs include editor of <cite>Time</cite> as well as
chair and <abbr>CEO</abbr> of <abbr>CNN</abbr>. In short, he is a paragon of
establishment journalism himself.</p>

<p>Alas, judging by the excerpts and reviews, Isaacson’s book offers little
beyond a descriptive account of what Musk said or did over the years. He doesn’t
really probe. He doesn’t provide context. He doesn’t analyze. According to <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/elon-musk-walter-isaacson-book-review">Jill
Lepore’s review</a> in the <cite>New Yorker</cite>, Isaacson’s retelling of
Musk’s childhood in apartheid South Africa “barely mentions apartheid” and
features “certainly no Black people.” <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-09-11/lets-put-a-stake-in-the-great-man-biography-starting-with-isaacsons-elon-musk">Brian
Merchant’s review</a> in the Los Angeles <cite>Times</cite> starts out with
taking exception to that literal white-washing, too.</p>

<p>It apparently sets the tone for the rest of the book, with Isaacson just
presenting the world according to Musk and various hangers-on. That is not to
say that it’s all rainbows and unicorns. Isaacson does register his bewilderment
about Musk’s mercurial and abrasive personality. He even calls him an “asshole.”
But he doesn’t go deeper. He never questions his own admiration for Musk. Even
after all is written and published, a week after book release <a
href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/09/on-with-kara-swisher-walter-isaacson-on-his-elon-musk-book.html">on
Kara Swisher’s podcast</a> for <cite>New York</cite>, he hedges anything
critical with an immediate “but…” followed by a long-winded explanation of
Musk’s supposed impact, i.e., greatness. In that same interview, Isaacson states
he doesn’t believe that Musk has read the book. So we don’t know whether the
book serves Musk, whose hunger for validation appears to be just as insatiable
as Trump’s, only Trump conjures up audience sizes where Musk mints startup
founder titles.</p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby=masterclass class=drop-heading>
<h2 id=masterclass>A Masterclass in Journalistic Malpractice</h2>

<p>What is certain, however, is that the book doesn’t serve us, the general
public. To illustrate just that, I am going to provide the missing context for
the <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/09/ai-for-cars-walter-isaacson-biography-of-elon-musk-excerpt.html">excerpt
published by <abbr>CNBC</abbr></a>. It turns out to be a veritable masterclass
in journalistic malpractice. If you haven’t read the excerpt, I recommend you do
before continuing. It is only 1,500 words or about 12 minutes long. Plus,
Isaacson’s decades of journalistic practice weren’t entirely wasted. He sure has
a way with words and his pithy prose is easy on the reader.</p>

<p>In case you don’t care to read it yourself, the excerpt concerns itself with
something Tesla calls <em>full self-driving capability</em> or <abbr>FSD</abbr>.
According to Isaacson, the system under development until early this year was
rule-based at its core, comprising “hundreds of thousands of lines of C++ code
to apply these rules to complex situations.” But then OpenAI’s release of
ChatGPT inspired Tesla’s engineers to replace that core with a deep neural
network. Again according to Isaacson, that effort resulted in a significant
improvement of <abbr>FSD</abbr>.</p>

<p>A test drive with Musk in the driver’s seat (but hands off the steering
wheel) in mid-April 2023 went so well, Musk “started whistling Mozart’s ‘A
Little Night Music’ serenade in G major.” By August, Tesla was ready to release
<abbr>FSD 12</abbr>, the first version to incorporate the new approach, as soon
as regulators would approve. Musk showed it off publicly on August 25, 2023 by
live-streaming himself driving around the South Bay including past Meta
<abbr>CEO</abbr> Mark Zuckerberg’s home. As receipts, the excerpt includes two
different stills from said livestream, which are curiously grainy and out of
focus but Musk and a Tesla’s interior are recognizable nonetheless.</p>

<p>Impressively, Simon &amp; Schuster published the biography only 18 calendar
days or 11 work days after Musk’s South Bay drive. It seems unlikely that they
were able to cram content revisions, copy edits, planning for marketing
campaign, printing, binding, and shipping into two weeks. I figure that much of
the book was already printed and they only finished that chapter, or updated it,
during those two weeks. Still, that’s nimble for book publishing and minimizes
the risk that some major event between editorial deadline and publication steals
the book’s thunder. Unlike Isaacson, I didn’t have privileged access to Musk and
hence draw on public sources only for this section. Some are informal, like one
Reddit comment, but the vast majority are major news organizations such as
Reuters and the <cite>Times</cite>. With one significant exception, a study by
Mozilla published in early September, all my source material was published
before Isaacson’s editorial deadline. In other words, there really is no good
excuse for not covering most of this context as well.</p>

<hr>

<p>I count five significant omissions and misdirections in the excerpt. Let’s
discuss each in turn.</p>


<!-- 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 -->

<h3>The False Promise of Autonomous Driving</h3>

<p>By writing about “self-driving,” “full self-driving,” and “<abbr>FSD</abbr>”
without further elaboration, Isaacson plays right along with
<a
href="https://www.capitalone.com/cars/learn/finding-the-right-car/tesla-full-selfdriving-beta-now-costs-15000-heres-why/1900">what
Capital One,</a> a bank, calls a “disingenuously named suite of advanced
driver-assistance features.” As they noted late last year, <abbr>FSD</abbr>
still has a very long way to go before offering autonomous driving. Furthermore,
better driver-assistance features are available from other car makers for much
less.</p>

<p>Tesla first introduced driver-assistance (“Autopilot”) in late 2015. The
following year, Musk <a
href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware">made
quite a splash</a> by seemingly announcing that autonomous driving was coming to
Tesla’s cars within the year. He has been promising the same, autonomous driving
coming to Tesla’s car within the year, ever since. Alas, Tesla first made a test
version of <abbr>FSD</abbr> available to select customers only in late 2020. It
also began charging $8,000 for this test version. By now, the price has
increased to $15,000. Still, that hasn’t deterred 360,000 customers from paying
big bucks for testing Tesla’s buggy software—software that controls vehicles,
i.e., devices designed to move people at significant speed.</p>

<p>The consequences of doing so are entirely predictable: Earlier this year, a
<a
href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/massive-trove-of-tesla-files-contains-thousands-of-safety-complaints/">massive
leak of internal documents to Germany’s <cite>Handelsblatt</cite> newspaper</a>
revealed that Tesla’s cars are prone to sudden de/acceleration, without and with
Autopilot and <abbr>FSD</abbr>, and that the firm received more than 3,000
complaints about Autopilot and <abbr>FSD</abbr> safety. The documents also
revealed instructions to Tesla’s employees to never put anything in writing,
insisting on oral communication only. This was confirmed by owners of
malfunctioning Teslas, like a medical doctor whose car, when they were turning
into a parking lot, suddenly accelerated and came to a stop only after hitting
two cement bollards in a row. That policy reminds me of another upstanding
character with a well-known aversion to putting things in writing. What was his
name again? Trusk?</p>

<p>While Isaacson parrots marketing terms without elaboration and stays mum on
Tesla’s safety record, he does acknowledge at the end of the excerpt that there
still is one remaining regulatory concern. Apparently, <abbr>FSD</abbr>, like
“95% of humans,” has a tendency to “creep slowly through stop signs, rather than
coming to a complete stop.” Aw-shucks, if we keep doing it, then
<abbr>FSD</abbr> doing it is just fine. It feels like Isaacson only added this
disclaimer so he wouldn’t appear too sycophantic without upsetting Musk. In his
interview with Swisher, he still was bullish on <abbr>FSD 12</abbr>. It almost
sounded like he too is now promising that autonomous driving is coming to
Tesla’s cars within the year.</p>


<!-- 2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222 -->

<h3>Inflated Driving Range</h3>

<p>Musk and Tesla relentlessly hyping <abbr>FSD</abbr> as capable of autonomous
driving for over seven years is problematic, to say the least. It gives the
appearance that they are misleading intentionally for their own financial gain.
That impression is further strengthened by the obviously misleading name of the
feature and the very selective release of information about its technology. When
I searched for background material about Tesla’s driver-assistance technology, I
noticed that seemingly none of these articles discussed the rule-based core of
all but the latest version of <abbr>FSD</abbr>. In a way, that wasn’t too
surprising, since rule-based systems are not exactly the frontier of
<abbr>AI</abbr> technology.</p>

<p>At the same time, the large echo chamber of websites apparently run by Tesla
fanboys generates an awful amount of noise. Fact is that Tesla, just like other
car makers, has been <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/e5x08v/rule_based_or_reinforced_learning_whats_the/">using
machine learning models</a> for <em>perception</em>—determining road conditions
including the movement of other vehicles, the hyperlocal weather, the presence
of construction zones, and so on—and the rule-based system for
<em>prediction</em>—deciding how to make the best of these road conditions—
until they re-architected the latter starting late last year. Tesla
overpromising self-driving features, using a misleading name, and cherrypicking
what technical details it hypes to fanboys may point to a larger pattern of
misleading customers and investors. But they could also be the result of less
malign forces, say, an overexcitable <abbr>CEO</abbr> with little to no impulse
control.</p>


<aside class=pullquote>
<p>Tesla’s cars systematically inflate the remaining driving range</p>
</aside>


<p>Alas, there is no room for such benefit of the doubt in another case: As <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/"><cite>Reuters</cite>
revealed in July 2023</a>, Tesla’s cars inflate the remaining driving range.
Since discrepancies between actual and cooked numbers become more noticeable at
small ranges, Tesla’s cars also shrink the inflationary multiplier. That last
bit of deception makes very clear that the range inflation is intentional, even
if customers experience it as a car-stopping bug. It gets worse: If a customer
noticed that their car’s range prediction was off and called Tesla for support,
they were handed off to a dedicated team charged with preventing customers from
bringing cars to repair shops. After all, from the perspective of Tesla, there
was nothing wrong with the car. Finally, for having the audacity to notice
Tesla’s range inflation scam, those same customers were placed on a blocklist.
Future calls for support would go straight to voicemail. The customers then had
to wait for a callback a couple of days later.</p>

<p>That last bit is amazingly petty, with Tesla having no excuse to act that
way. More generally, it sure looks like Tesla is willing to use extralegal means
including deception and worse to maximize its own profit potential.
Unfortunately, all-important customer safety comes second—at best. Inflating the
driving range is bound to result in stranded vehicles, no matter the measures
taken to reduce such possibility. That’s a rather serious failing for a company
selling cars, which are intended to be an expedient and reliable means for
getting from A to B. It all points to one basic truth: Tesla has little respect
for its customers and, at times, even treats them with outright contempt.</p>

<h3>Controversial Engineering Choice</h3>

<p>In the excerpt, Isaacson hints at another technology having profound impact
on Tesla’s cars. Each Tesla car nowadays has nine outward-facing cameras and at
least one more monitoring the car’s interior. The outward-facing cameras are
critical because, unlike other companies working towards autonomous driving,
Tesla never installed lidar in their cars and recently stopped installing radar
and ultrasonic sensors as well. Hence its cars’ driver-assistance critically
depends on those video feeds. There is nothing else.</p>

<p>The wisdom of this decision continues to be highly controversial. Fact is
that <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230202072054/https://scale.com/blog/is-elon-wrong-about-lidar">object-recognition
based on video alone</a> is noticeably less accurate. Furthermore, many <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2022/10/31/former-head-of-tesla-ai-explains-why-theyve-removed-sensors-others-differ/">automated
tasks become much harder</a> when only video is available. Tesla’s
driver-assistance bears this out: After removing radar and ultrasonics from its
cars, the firm restricted some assisted driving features and disabled many
parking features altogether. The company promises that their solely video-based
replacements will be coming to Tesla’s cars within the year.</p>

<p>Tesla is correct when it contends that multiple kinds of sensors do add
hardware costs and significantly increase software complexity. Assuming that
Tesla can restore previous functionality for its driver-assistance based on
video alone, the critical concern is reliability, especially when compared to
other systems that incorporate lidar, radar, and ultrasonics. Since failure to
recognize an “obstacle” such as a bicyclist or pedestrian is measured in human
injuries and fatalities, the reliability of <abbr>AI</abbr>-based perception has
tremendous impact on car safety. Meanwhile the safety of Tesla’s cars impacts
only everyone sharing streets with them, i.e., <em>all of us</em>.</p>


<aside class=pullquote>
<p>Are regulators waiting for v2.0 of “<cite>Unsafe at Any Speed</cite>” with a
Tesla Pinto on its cover?</p>
</aside>


<p>In this context, <cite>Handelsblatt</cite>’s revelations about Tesla’s lack
of disclosure when it comes to accidents and <cite>Reuters</cite> revelations
about Tesla’s systematic driving range grift don’t instill confidence. Quite the
opposite. Hence I cannot but wonder whether the decision to go video-only really
was a (maverick) engineering decision or yet another attempt at seeking a
financial advantage while ignoring the downsides to others. For the same reason,
I cannot but wonder why state and federal regulators allow Tesla to continue
selling its driver-assistance features and haven’t forced the company to recall
the add-on. Or are they waiting for version 2.0 of <cite>Unsafe at Any
Speed</cite>, to be released in time for the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/automobiles/50-years-ago-unsafe-at-any-speed-shook-the-auto-world.html">first
version’s 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary</a> in 2025, now with a Tesla Pinto on the
cover?!</p>

<h3>Car Surveillance</h3>

<p>Digital video cameras have another, unavoidable problem: They may just record
people. Worse, due to ubiquitous internet access, such recordings may just
become accessible by the wrong people. Tesla’s cars easily check all necessary
boxes. They have at least 10 cameras built in. They have cellular and WiFi
modems built in. They record their geographical position. Tesla’s engineers and
its labelling team have access to videos and location data. Previously, also the
subcontracted labellers in Africa had access to the videos. In several articles
I read while writing this article, Tesla’s response to journalists’ questions
was that the firm takes privacy seriously and furthermore anonymizes all
location data.</p>

<p>Even if Tesla strips location traces of obviously identifying information, I
wouldn’t count on that to make much difference when it comes to privacy. As the
New York <cite>Times</cite> demonstrated in several articles in December 2019,
they could easily de-anonymize people whose location traces were included in a
commercially available dataset assembled by an ad-tech firm. That way, the
<cite>Times</cite> traced many of the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/21/opinion/pasadena-smartphone-spying.html">people
living in a California town</a>, <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/21/opinion/location-data-democracy-protests.html">protestors
from picket lines and political rallies</a>, legislative aides to members of
Congress, civilian employees at the Department of Defense, military officers,
members of the United States’ clandestine services, and <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/20/opinion/location-data-national-security.html">through
Secret Service agents <abbr>POTUS</abbr>
himself</a>. For good measure, in February 2021 the <cite>Times</cite> used a
more recent dataset to track down <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/opinion/capitol-attack-cellphone-data.html">members
of the murderous mob trying to stage a coup</a> on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>The <cite>Times</cite>’ investigations were conducted as a public service, to
encourage critical debate. Two years later, in July 2021, the Washington
<cite>Post</cite> broke news of the first high-profile case of private actors
weaponizing commercially available location data to force their political agenda
onto others. As a result, the <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/catholic-priest-grindr-pillar/2021/07/24/b2772f02-ecb6-11eb-8950-d73b3e93ff7f_story.html">closeted
chief administrator of the <abbr>US</abbr> Conference of Catholic Bishops</a>
was forced to resign. In the aftermath, the people responsible for this
unparalleled invasion of privacy and despicable campaign of innuendo, which
equates homosexuality with child abuse while simultaneously denying it,
announced that many more revelations would follow.</p>

<p>Only they didn’t. They instead went into stealth mode. In March 2023, the
<cite>Post</cite> followed up by reporting that a not-for-profit involving some
of the same people had <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/03/09/catholics-gay-priests-grindr-data-bishops/">spent
millions of dollars purchasing location data from gay dating apps</a> and had
been outing de-anonymized priests to their bishops. Amazingly for self-described
“Christians,” much of the commentary from Catholic observers has been approving.
It seems only a question of time until location data will be similarly
weaponized against women seeking abortions.</p>


<aside class=pullquote>
<p>Amongst this terrible bunch, Tesla stood out as the worst of the worst</p>
</aside>


<p>At the same time, there are good reasons not to trust Tesla with such data.
First, when the Mozilla Foundation published the results of a <a
href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/">privacy
review of 25 car makers</a> in September 2023, they concluded that cars were the
worst product category they reviewed so far. Every single car maker received
their “Privacy Not Included” warning label. Amongst this terrible bunch, Tesla
stood out as the worst of the worst, receiving “dings” across all criteria,
something only one other product achieved before. Second, as <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-workers-shared-sensitive-images-recorded-by-customer-cars-2023-04-06/"><cite>Reuters</cite>
revealed in April 2023</a>, firm employees including many members of their
labelling team have been sharing clips of car videos, often memeified, in both
work and private chats. Worse, in interviews with <cite>Reuters</cite>, several
former and current employees said they saw nothing wrong with this fundamentally
violative behavior. As the <abbr>ACLU</abbr> noted in April, <a
href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/tesla-camera-scandal-is-the-latest-lesson-in-dangers-of-letting-companies-record-you">such
abuses are all but guaranteed</a> when devices include remote-accessible
microphones or cameras.</p>

<p>That is particularly unsettling because Tesla’s cars not only record their
surroundings and interior while driving. They also record their surroundings as
a preventive measure while sitting idle, i.e., when parked. Many videos shared
by employees were actually recorded in this so-called sentry mode, demonstrating
that Tesla does <em>not</em> take customers’ privacy seriously. If the firm did,
labellers wouldn’t have access to those clips. It’s no surprise then that <a

<p>In Europe, Tesla settled two court cases, <a

the
<abbr>EU</abbr>’s exemplary privacy law. To settle the matters, the firm
committed to changing its advertising, educating customers about the
implications of sentry mode, and modifying said mode to flash car lights as a
sign that people are about to be recorded. Disappointingly, regulators in the
Netherlands and Germany concluded that car owners alone are the “data
controller” of record. That obviously is the wrong conclusion, since Tesla
continues to have access to cars and their videos and, given its record, isn’t
exactly credible when it declares not to access just the video files. In either
case, Tesla’s cars are

<h3 class=invisible>Musk Fights Zuckerberg</h3>

<p>The final misdirection concerns Meta <abbr>CEO</abbr> Mark Zuckerberg. In
Isaacson’s telling Musk had been “jokingly challenging” Zuckerberg to
hand-to-hand combat. Except the reality is rather more complicated. Musk had
<a
href="https://www.platformer.news/p/its-time-to-change-how-we-cover-elon">challenged
Zuckerberg indeed</a>. But Zuckerberg is going through a <em>Muscle Mary</em>
phase, <a rel=noreferrer
href="https://www.x.com/verge/status/1671685350262026240?lang=en">posting
pictures of himself</a> that wouldn’t look out of place on Grindr, and so he
accepted the challenge. For several weeks, Musk was stringing Zuckerberg along,
until it became obvious that he was just trolling. It was all pretty elaborate,
involving Musk’s entourage, the Zuckerberg Chan Initiative, and even a cabinet
member of Italy’s government. In other words, the trolling was uncomfortably
close to being sincere, <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/15/23832701/elon-musk-lies-mark-zuckerberg-fight-creepy">leaving
even experienced industry observers guessing</a>. It also impacted many more
people than these two unhinged billionaires.</p>

<p>The lowpoint of this charade was the drive around the South Bay that opens
the excerpt from Isaacson’s book. But in manifest reality, the drive wasn’t
“much smoother and more reliable,” unless, that is, <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/28/23848882/elon-musk-tesla-fsd-v12-demo-red-light-zuckerberg-house">almost
running a red light</a>
and requiring manual intervention fits your definition of reliable. Then there
was the doxing drive-by. Isaacson does not disclose that Musk googled
Zuckerberg’s home address on camera and then declared that, since the address
was already public, he wasn’t doxing him. Yet in November 2022, Musk shut down
the account of a college student tracking the <a
href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-legal-action-elonjet-jack-sweeney-1849897068">whereabouts
of Musk’s private plane</a>. The student used only data that was already public
as well. At the same time, the flight data is considerably <em>less</em>
sensitive than a person’s home address. It’s hard to get more hypocritical than
this.</p>

<hr>

<p>You wouldn’t know <em>any of the above</em> if you only read Isaacson’s
excerpt. Admittedly, my material is a bit more technical, and my perspective is
far more critical. I also added another 2,400 words on top of Isaacson’s 1,500,
which probably aren’t quite as easy on the reader. But the material also covers
a lot of ground: I touch upon <abbr>AI</abbr> safety, car safety, engineering
trade-offs, privacy, surveillance capitalism, the dangers of religious
fundamentalism, and the foibles of billionaires. Maybe excepting the latter,
these are important topics of public interest, with considerable impact on our
lives.</p>


<aside class=pullquote>
<p>Musk’s genius seems largely of the “very stable” kind</p>
</aside>


<p>And then there is Tesla. A significant reason for why I kept working on this
article, turning what started out as a comment on a friend’s Facebook post into
my own, more substantial Facebook post and then into this even more substantial
blog post is that I used the occassion as opportunity for learning more about
the car maker. Working through the material was eye-opening, since the firm’s
manifest reality and its hype amongst the software engineering set seem to have
very little in commom. Tesla not only looks like just another car maker but one
that goes to extralegal and unsafe lengths for its own financial gain. The fact
that Musk steered the firm down this path shows that his supposed genius largely
is of the “very stable” kind and no more.</p>

<p>If that was the extent of Musk’s endeavors, there probably would be no
Isaacson biography of Musk. At the same time, Tesla is critical for Musk’s
influence because its overpriced stock, which is trading at a <abbr>P/E</abbr>
ratio of 65.8, down from 190 at the end of 2021, is the very foundation of his
obscene wealth. So the firm is well worth our attention. But Musk has been
muscling himself into more and more lines of business. In addition to cars,
companies that he leads or controls build tunnels, batteries, solar cells,
computer implants, space rockets, satellite networks, and advanced
<abbr>AI</abbr> systems. They also provide launch services into space, voice and
data communication across the globe, as well as news and social networking.</p>

<p>That is an impressive portfolio. It certainly necessitates a good hard look
at the man himself and how he conducts business. In particular, two more areas
stand out: Musk’s influence on the governments of the United States and Ukraine
as well as his takeover of Twitter and conversion into X. Since I have already
shown Isaacson to be an unreliable narrator, for the next two sections I’ll
largely be drawing on other sources, starting with Ronan Farrow.</p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby=sovereign-threat>
<h2 id=sovereign-threat>Elon Musk as Sovereign Threat</h2>

<p>Farrow, in his August 21, 2023 <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule">profile
of Musk for the <cite>New Yorker</cite></a>, does take a good hard look at
Musk’s considerable influence over <abbr>US</abbr> government policy, notably
when it comes to energy, military, and space exploration. That influence is due
to Tesla, which sells batteries and solar cells in addition to cars, as well as
SpaceX, which makes and launches space rockets. Musk founded the company with
the goal of colonizing Mars. To finance that vision, the firm focused on
offering more and cheaper launch capacity than the established competition,
primarily Europe’s Arianespace. By <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_launch_market_competition">leveraging
up-to-date technology and relentlessly persuing ever larger rockets</a>, SpaceX
succeeded in just that: By 2018, it had a market share of 65%. In 2023, it
largely was the same with 66%. But with 88% of all <abbr>US</abbr> launches, <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-spacex-now-has-a-de-facto-monopoly-on-rocket-launches-3c34f02e">SpaceX
almost has a total monopoly power over the domestic market</a>, including over
<abbr>NASA</abbr>.</p>

<p>As SpaceX was able to scale launch capacity, it also was able to leverage
some for its own Starlink satellites, which provide voice and data services. By
now, over 5,000 satellites literally <a
href="https://satellitemap.space/?constellation=starlink">litter low Earth
orbit</a> (<abbr>LEO</abbr>). The firm plans to launch another 7,000 of them and
to <a href="https://www.starlink.com/map">provide voice and data communications
everywhere on Earth</a>—with exception of Afghanistan, Belarus, China, Iran,
North Korea, Russia, Syria, and Venezuela. Since <abbr>LEO</abbr> is not
geostationary, those countries are not excluded for lack of coverage.</p>

<p>Farrow focuses on Musk’s impact on Ukraine’s fight against the Russian
aggressor, where Starlink plays a critical role as the only reliable means for
communication amongst Ukrainian soldiers. At the beginning of the invasion,
Russian hackers had knocked out much of Ukrainian telecommunications including
satellite access, which significantly hampered the country’s ability to defend
itself, to say nothing about eventually reclaiming its own territory. Starlink
was not yet activated in Ukraine but, in theory, provided an attractive
alternative: Its design features many more satellites that cover a much smaller
area, making it harder to disrupt communications, and utilize the latest in
encryption, making it hard to intercept the content.</p>

<p>Two days into the war in February 2022, the Ukrainian government asked Musk
for access to Starlink on Twitter. To his credit, Musk immediately agreed and
the first terminals arrived in Ukraine only two days later. By now, several
thousand terminals are put to good use in Ukraine, most of which donated by
members of the Ukrainian community in Silicon Valley, the United States, and
European governments. For the first several months, SpaceX generously covered
usage charges as well. But in September 2022, the firm sent a letter to the
Pentagon that it is “not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine,
or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time.” As Farrow
observes, SpaceX was recently valued at $150 billion and its <abbr>CEO</abbr>
at $220 billion. Meanwhile, Ukraine is fighting for its very survival as a
country.</p>


<aside class=pullquote>
<p>Putin’s core competency is keeping oligarchs in line</p>
</aside>


<p>Given those riches, surely money can’t be that much of an issue. While Musk
denies as much, it does seem that Russia’s president Vladimir Putin got to him.
Apparently, the two have fairly regular conversations and, if Putin has a core
competency that he finely honed over the more than two decades of his autocratic
rule, it’s his ability to keep oligarchs in line. He demonstrated as much to an
incredulous Western audience in July 2018, when <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44852812">Trump took the side of
this murderous thug</a> over the <abbr>FBI</abbr> and the United States’
clandestine services after talking to Putin in private for two hours. That same
persuasive power seems to have convinced Musk last year that further support for
Ukraine might just start nuclear armageddon. Thereafter, Musk publicly declared
that Putin wants peace and that Ukraine must accept the loss of Crimea. Excuse
me?</p>

<p>More ominously, both Isaacson and Farrow describe apparently unrelated
incidents, during which the Ukrainian military suddenly found itself without
Starlink coverage and had to retreat. Devastatingly, that effectively ended an
attack on Russia’s Black Sea fleet before it even started. Musk didn’t, as
Isaacson falsely asserted in the excerpt published by the <cite>Post</cite>,
shut down coverage as those missions were progressing. Musk simply had never
enabled coverage in some locations and apparently “forgot” to tell the Ukrainian
government about this rather important detail. Meanwhile, the Russian Navy has
continued shelling Ukrainian cities and prevented the export of Ukrainian grain,
causing hunger worldwide. The episode also features prominently in Elizabeth
Lopatto’s <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/1/23895069/walter-isaacson-biography-musk-review">sharply
critical piece for the <cite>Verge</cite></a>, which bemoans that Isaacson’s
biography has resulted in “two unreliable narrators.”</p>

<p>By now, Starlink has entered a formal agreement with the Pentagon and hence
Ukraine’s battlefield communications are on a more solid footing again. While
clearly the most important episode with the biggest potential downsides, Farrow
chronicles several other instances of Musk, Tesla, or SpaceX being unduly
confrontational about <abbr>US</abbr> law or policy and Biden administration
officials going out of their way to pacify him. That also is my impression of
past court proceedings, where he was treated with far more deference than anyone
less wealthy would have been. Yet just a few days ago, the <cite>Wall Street
Journal</cite> ran an editorial registering its outrage about the “<a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-biden-administration-justice-department-investigations-accdd84a">harassment
of Elon Musk</a>.” That way, the editorial team graphically demonstrated once
again that it is completely unencumbered by manifest reality. Their debasement
in service of making this world a better place for plutocrats really knows no
bounds. How much is Murdoch paying them?</p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby=extremist-x>
<h2 id=extremist-x>Extremist X Née Twitter</h2>

<p>So far, I have covered considerable self-dealing at Tesla at cost of car
safety and interference with <abbr>US</abbr> policy notably by enabling and
simultaneously subverting Ukraine’s ability to defend itself. Their longterm
consequences are far from clear at this point. I can’t but wonder what Tesla’s
shortcuts on car safety imply for SpaceX, especially given the company’s plans
for manned space travel. Yet we are still not done covering the highlights of
Musk’s activities and influence. This third part concerns his takeover of
Twitter and conversion into X, favorite hangout of far-right extremists, who
joined in the wake of his takeover. They were attracted by Musk’s loud
declarations of free-speech absolutism and his promise to reinstate previously
banned accounts. They are staying because they can increasingly claim Musk as
one of their own.</p>

<p>Musk does indeed leverage his platform on X for plainly political statements,
for example, when <a
href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-vote-republican-rcna56024">encouraging
people to vote Republican on election day in November 2022</a>. But that also
was unusually conventional in its directness and content. More common are cases
where Musk engages with off-color posts by his many followers or ends up
amplifying bizarre ideas, for example, when <a
href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/twitter-elon-musk-voting-rights-nonparents-18183380.php">supporting
the restriction of voting rights to child-bearing parents</a> or when <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/31/1132906782/elon-musk-twitter-pelosi-conspiracy">claiming
that Nancy Pelosi’s husband was attacked by a male prostitute instead of a
deranged far-right extremist</a>. In other words, Musk’s political influence
through X isn’t that of a conventional political activist but more diffuse and
even confused. It does lean towards far-right ideas and hence is anything but
benign. More generally, it reflects the right’s embrace of conspiratorial and
plainly unhinged ideas. In what follows, I’ll first contextualize X under Musk
based on personal experience and then provide a high-level overview of his first
year as owner of X née Twitter.</p>


<h3>My Own Experience</h3>

<p>I got a taste of who hangs out on X nowadays in July 2023, when I <a
rel=noreferrer href="https://x.com/apparebit/status/1680945505923211264">posted
about the striking parallels between an AfD event poster and Nazi propaganda</a>
(in English). Like other political parties in Germany, the AfD uses a
three-letter acronym. It stands for Alternative für Deutschland or Alternative
for Germany. Over the ten years since its founding as a far-right party, the AfD
has only moved further and further rightward and by now is openly embracing
anti-democratic and neofascist extremism. Despite unusually blunt and public
warnings by, amongst others, the director of Germany’s domestic intelligence
service, the AfD is currently polling at around 20%.</p>

<p>At first, my post saw little engagement. But after it was re-posted a couple
of times by Germans, comments started trickling in over several more days. Many
of the comments, all posted from accounts <em>opened after Musk’s take-over</em>
of Twitter, were not only sympathetic to the AfD but full of antisemitic and
homophobic sentiment. They also contained an impressive amount of gaslighting
about the democratic process and other parties’ positions. The most extreme
comments normalized Naziism and one account threatened me, for good measure in
both comment and re-post. Alas, almost all of these comments were phrased
carefully to maintain plausible deniability. For instance, the threat, when
translated from the German original, reads: “You are scared of the AfD, Robert.
And that – IS – ALSO – REEAAL – GOOOD !!! 😁👍” I did report one comment that
clearly crossed the line to X. It was deemed acceptable.</p>

<p>The weird part in all this is the fact that my post didn’t even go viral. Far
from it. It got only 2,200 impressions, 7 likes, and 4 re-posts, one from the
account that threatened me. Yet it also generated more than 40 comments if you
follow all threads to their deplorable ends. That is one magnitude more comments
than <a rel=noreferrer
href="https://x.com/apparebit/status/1517472451692740609">my last viral
tweet</a>, which received 50,000 impressions and 400 likes, but triggered hardly
any discussion. (That tweet also was reported for being in violation of German
law, an allegation that Twitter rightly rejected.) After reading the first few
comments, I decided not to engage the comments beyond liking insightful comments
by non-extremists. They still are present on X. But for the most part, the
comments were a pile-on by far-right extremists from both sides of the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>The following comments, made by an American and a German far-right
sympathizer, are instructive. Both started by responding to my post, with the
German becoming one of the more prolific commenters. Meanwhile, the American
only commented twice. His direct, English response to my post read:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://x.com/qaysibnalmulawa/status/1683634022423969795">
<p>Either you get German right wing parties or you become an Islamic
fundamentalist state where gays are pushed off mountains and women can't leave
the house without a man. I know what I’d choose. But take a look at your second
option yourself:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The embedded post includes a clip of two men seemingly interviewing a young
Muslim on the street. With little discernible emotion, the young man declares
his support for the introduction of Sharia law in Germany, if necessary by
force, and killing gay people by throwing them off mountains. If that hits most
of the key points of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Replacement">Great Replacement
conspiracy theory</a>, then that is very much by design.</p>

<p> Titles embedded in the clip were sufficient for locating its source, a
far-right organization led by a known provocateur obsessed with Islam. The group
holds rallies across German cities with hard-to-miss incendiary posters about
“political Islam” and engages Muslims in the audience with a mix of
condescension and leading questions. The goal is to provoke frustrated and
over-the-top responses. They then post video recordings of their rallies on
YouTube. This particular clip is from a <a rel="noreferrer nofollow"
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOxNctvlXqQ">rally at Berlin’s
Alexanderplatz on October 21, 2022</a> (annotated in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> to
disavow the content and prevent browsers from sending a referrer). The
conversation with the young man starts at the <time
datetime=PT4H38M38S>4:38:38</time> mark.</p>


<aside class=pullquote>
<p>When asked to pick Muslim fanatics or fascists, the right choice is rejecting
both.</p>
</aside>


<p>Their provocation obviously does <em>not</em> justify the young man’s
extremist agenda. But the American’s suggestion to pick and chose between the
two sides is utterly preposterous as well. Both Muslim fanatics and fascists are
genocidal extremists. No good will come from either group. When faced with a
false dilemma like this, the only reasonable choice is refusing to participate
and walk away. Ideally, they would destroy each other, but they need each other
too much for that. That the American presents this false dilemma as an actual
one gives his own extremist agenda away. So does the fact that he knows to share
video footage shot by a minor celebrity in Germany’s far-right circles.</p>

<p>It’s no suprise then that he recognized a kindred crank in the German and
addressed him thusly (in the original English): <q
cite="https://x.com/qaysibnalmulawa/status/1683635285551112193">Finally, a sane
European! Man, glad to see you guys aren’t a lost cause after all, and all the
best to you!</q> The German then replied:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://x.com/IsaAuswe/status/1683813080306798594" class=tight>
<p>Thank you, brother.</p>
<p>Conservative views are on the rise Europe wide actually - many have had
enough of societal and political depravation [sic]!</p>
<p>Wish u the best as well!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find the seamless back-and-forth between the tender embrace of a perceived
sympathizer and the (misspelled) dehumanization of perceived enemies
disorienting. Tender embrace, dehumanization, tender embrace. Off. On. Off. This
selective display of inhuman designs, especially when combined with constant
gaslighting about, say, their deeply held concerns for the welfare of gay men
and women, is also what makes these comments so insidious and dangerous. People
with a less well-honed sense for language and demagoguery fall for this veneer
of moderation and respectability—though they also willfully ignore its deeply
brown coloring.</p>

<p>I covered this episode in some detail not because it revealed some new lows
of incivility or dehumanizing excess. It doesn’t. But the pile-on of far-right
comments, with their insidious suggestiveness, in broad daylight on what used to
be a mainstream forum by accounts only opened after Musk’s takeover of Twitter
seems representative of the transformation from Twitter into X. It plainly gives
credence to headlines such as <cite>The Guardian</cite>’s assertion that “<a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/03/twitter-conservative-media-elon-musk-ron-desantis">Twitter’s
rightwing takeover is complete</a>.” That outcome, however, is no accident. It
is the direct result of Musk’s words and deeds. Let’s summarize them.</p>


<h3>Musk’s Record</h3>

<p>If you listened to Musk during the months before his takeover of Twitter in
October 2022, he was adamant that the main problem with Twitter was suppression
of speech. Declaring himself a “free speech absolutist,” he promised to turn
things around. So has he followed through? Over the last year, Musk did <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-accounts-reinstated-elon-musk-donald-trump-kanye-ye-jordan-peterson-kathy-griffin-andrew-tate/">reactivate
the accounts</a> of Andrew Tate (who was banned for blaming rape victims and is
currently being prosecuted in Romania for raping and trafficking women), Donald
Trump (banned for attempting a coup), Ye (banned for antisemitic tirades), and
Kathy Griffin (banned after Musk’s take-over for making fun of Musk). In
response, Tate, Trump, and Ye returned to X. Griffin impolitely declined.</p>

<p>At the same time, Musk shut down the account of a college student tracking the
<a
href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-legal-action-elonjet-jack-sweeney-1849897068">whereabouts
of Musk’s private plane</a>. He also shut down the accounts of several reporters
including ones working for <abbr>CNN</abbr>, the New York <cite>Times</cite>,
<cite>Insider</cite>, and the Washington <cite>Post</cite>. After a public
outcry and <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2022/12/16/european-union-official-warns-elon-musk-of-sanctions-over-twitter-banning-journalists/"><abbr>EU</abbr>
warning of sanctions</a>, Musk <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/17/business/elon-musk-twitter-ban-reverse-conditions/">offered
to reinstate acccounts</a> but only under condition that reporters agreed to his
demonstrably false version of events. In at least <a
href="https://news.yahoo.com/business-insider-journalist-brands-elon-065909297.html">one
case</a>, he didn’t even follow through on this Orwellian offer. In India, X has
been <a
href="https://theintercept.com/2023/03/28/twitter-modi-india-punjab-amritpal-singh/">broadly
censoring critics of Modi’s government</a> including a <abbr>BBC</abbr>
documentary. It also <a
href="https://restofworld.org/2023/elon-musk-twitter-government-orders/">complies
with more government requests</a> than Twitter and does so more fully. More
recently, X started <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/15/twitter-x-links-delayed/">throttling
outgoing links</a> to the New York <cite>Times</cite>, Substack, and competing
social networks.</p>

<p>These actions are clearly inconsistent with free speech absolutism. They are
even inconsistent with industry-wide moderation practices. The appeasement of
foreign governments might be consistent with financial self-interest. But Musk’s
financial self-interest can’t be that strong when his mercurial leadership
obviously is the primary force driving big name advertisers other than Apple
away. Surprisingly, they prefer not to be associated with the toxicity of a
Tate, Trump, Ye, and other far-right personalities Musk restored to the
platform. The attendant growth of far-right users, whom Musk keeps goading on,
doesn’t help either.</p>

<p>At the same time, all actions are consistent with somebody, who is so rich he
feels above most people, who is so insecure he requires constant public praise,
who nonetheless is incredibly petty and vindictive, and who self-radicalized on
Twitter, turning into a performative far-right troll. In short, Donald Trump.
And also Elon Musk, who outdid Trump by buying the platform outright. Given that
record, the <cite>Nation</cite> does seem justified in labelling Musk “<a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/elon-musk-threat-democracy/">a
threat to democracy</a>.”</p>

<hr>

<p>You’d think that’s enough malign impact for a single human being. But there
still are two more things to cover in this overview of Musk’s first year heading
X née Twitter. To begin with, Musk is not heading the firm anymore. After <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/twitter-users-vote-elon-musk-quit-ceo-poll-rcna62332">57.5%
of Twitter’s users</a> (including me) voted in favor of his ouster as
<abbr>CEO</abbr> in December 2022, he eventually followed through on this
particular promise and did hire Linda Yaccarino, until then head of advertising
at NBCUniversal, as <abbr>CEO</abbr> in May 2023. Meanwhile, he retains the
<abbr>CTO</abbr> title for himself. (I’m surprised that he hasn’t claimed to be
founder of X.) Four months later, she appears to be <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23874008/x-ceo-linda-yaccarino-executive-team-memo">asserting
her control</a> by bringing in her own executive team, most of whom have a
background in media, not technology.</p>

<p>But when she <a
href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/09/what-x-ceo-linda-yaccarino-claimed-at-the-code-conference.html">publicly
parrots</a> Musk’s false claims that X is “based on free expression and freedom
of speech,” yet isn’t even aware of his publicly announced plans to charge all
users, she doesn’t come across as X’s <abbr>CEO</abbr> but a second-rate
<abbr>PR</abbr> hack. Furthermore, her assertions that almost all advertisers
have returned to X and that X is close to profitability plainly strain
credulity. For one, Musk vented about X’s precarious financial state less than a
month ago and, for good measure, blamed it <a
href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2023-09-12/ty-article-magazine/.premium/warped-wrong-dangerous-adl-chief-on-elon-musks-elevation-of-antisemitic-vitriol/0000018a-890b-db38-a18b-ff7ba84b0000">on
the Anti-Defamation League</a>. I doubt most mainstream advertisers want to be
associated with such obviously antisemitic trolling. Furthermore, since X’s
ad-revenue sharing program effectively finances far-right extremists, it is only
a question of time until enterprising journalists detail those monetary flows in
a headline-making expose. Since Apple never ceased advertising on X, they might
just make a suitable target for this eventuality.</p>

<p>The attempts at restoring corporate normalcy may be re-assuring to some, but
I cannot forget scenes from <a
href="https://nymag.com/press/2023/01/extremely-hardcore-inside-twitter-under-elon-musk.html">Musk’s
“extremely hardcore” first three months</a>. They are seared into my mind,
largely for their astounding incompetence and cruelty. There was the spectacle
of laying off 75% of employees. Nobody really knew who was layed off and who
wasn’t. At best, former employees received an unsigned email informing them of
their lot. While the carnage was on-going, Musk and his goons issued and shortly
thereafter rescinded many orders that demonstrated a total lack of knowledge
about software development and management. Yet they also avoided any and all
contact with employees until well after the carnage finally subsided.</p>

<p>Probably the most disturbing episode happened shortly after the culling.
Twitter’s head of trust and safety Yoel Roth got along with Musk at first and so
stayed with the firm. But when Musk entirely ignored the recommendations made by
Roth’s team for <em>safely</em> opening up account validation and just what they
had predicted transpired, with more advertisers leaving, Roth resigned.
Afterwards, he wrote a rather measured <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/opinion/twitter-yoel-roth-elon-musk.html">op-ed
for the New York <cite>Times</cite></a> focusing solely on the staying power of
content moderation for platforms dependent on advertising and mobile phone app
stores.</p>

<p>Alas, that sufficed for triggering Musk, who drew on the worst of far-right
conspiracy theories, Pizzagate and QAnon, and started spreading false claims
that Roth had supported pedophilia in his PhD thesis. The <a
href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/technology/elon-musk-tweet-harassment-had-yoel-roth-sell-bay-area-home/article_71cb1914-a7f9-11ed-a860-03c86bad8979.html">resulting
harassment of Roth</a>, his family, and his thesis advisors was relentless.
After the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> published their home address, Roth and his
family had to flee the house and eventually sell it. In his interview with Kara
Swisher, Isaacson is audibly appalled when they discuss this episode. Isaacson
emphasizes that Roth and Musk got along well—until Musk turned on him—and that
Roth is a decent person, which Swisher confirms. She had already <a
rel=noreferrer
href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1601820143142989825">called out
Musk</a>
when it happened. Roth himself recently <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/opinion/trump-elon-musk-twitter.html">described
the harrowing consequences</a> in another op-ed for the <cite>Times</cite>.</p>

<p>This wasn’t even the first time that Musk has weaponized such a grotesque
accusation. In 2018, <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50695593">he called a heroic cave
diver “pedo guy” on Twitter</a> after the diver had rejected Musk’s attempts to
make himself the center of attention during the rescue of Thai children from a
cave. Unfortunately, the following year, a jury rejected the diver’s defamation
case. Musk clearly learned his lesson and applied it to Roth. Musk demonstrated
that same commitment to maximally abusing other humans when, in May 2023, he
encouraged other technology firms to <a
href="https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-says-other-tech-companies-should-lay-off-employees-like-he-did-at-twitter-382735-2023-05-25">follow
his example for laying off employees</a>.</p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby=great-men class=drop-heading>
<h2 id=great-men>These Great Men Are Trying to Murder Us!</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the podcast, Swisher and her producer recap reviews of
Isaacson’s book and discuss what topics to cover, what questions to ask. When
asked by her producer about her own review, Swisher responds with just one word,
“boredom.” My first thought while listening was “irrelevant.” But despite his
failure of writing an engaging and meaningful Musk biography, Isaacson isn’t
unsympathetic. I quite enjoyed listening to him and Swisher spar. It probably
helped that they consider each other friends and hence have an easy rapport.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean Swisher held back with her questions or criticisms. She
didn’t. And Isaacson showed little evasion or defensiveness but earnestly
engaged her for over an hour, repeatedly and generously acknowledging her past
advice to him as on-point and actionable. In short, he comes across as perfectly
pleasant and engaging, somebody eminently suitable to inviting for dinner and
having deep but also wideranging conversations with.</p>

<p>So why did Isaacson not go further with this biography? Musk’s self-image as
techno-messiah and his obscene wealth probably didn’t help. They invite, even
demand deference. Isaacson’s long-term position as paragon of establishment
journalism probably didn’t help either. Over the years he worked there,
<cite>Time</cite> and <abbr>CNN</abbr> weren’t exactly known for their
hardhitting interviews and studiously avoided upsetting the rich and powerful
too much. Such overly cozy treatment of the rich and powerful also betrays a
certain lack of ambition and hence feels by the numbers, or irrelevant and
boring.</p>

<p>But more than anything, Isaacson himself is deeply invested in great men. He
has been writing biographies about them for the last 30 years. Before Musk, he
covered Henry Kissinger, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs,
Leonardo da Vinci, and Jennifer Doudna. Between Jobs and da Vinci, he also wrote
a collection of biographical sketches of 57 men and 3 women he considers
critical for the “digital revolution.”</p>


<aside class=pullquote>
<p>6 out of 7 and 57 out of 60 still is an awful lot of men in all their gory
greatness</p>
</aside>


<p>This isn’t nearly the same league as claiming that “<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/arts/jann-wenner-the-masters-interview.html">none
of them [women] was articulate enough on this intellectual level</a>,” as
<cite>Rolling Stone</cite> co-founder Jann Wenner did last month. But
<sup>6</sup>∕<sub>7</sub> and <sup>57</sup>∕<sub>60</sub> still is an awful lot
of men in all their gory greatness. That makes me suspect that Isaacson might
just be afraid of what he would find if he dug deeper. He just seems beholden to
a world where great men (like maybe him a little) achieve great feats (like
maybe he does a little) and are widely recognized for their greatness (like
maybe he wants to be a little, especially since he’s 71 years old).</p>

<p>Then again, that really could be me projecting. I’m definitely not great and
my life’s work, especially of late, is entirely lacking in impact. However, I
have also been close enough to the centers of financial and technological might
to witness the devastating human toll great men and, increasingly, great women
exact on society. I was there when <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-bought-venezuelan-oil-co-bonds-last-week-1496020176">Goldman
Sachs facilitated a deal</a> that put good money on the eventuality of
Venezuela’s government serving foreign bond holders before the needs of its own
starving population. I was there when Facebook fanned the flames of antisemitic
prejudice by <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/technology/facebook-definers-opposition-research.html">astroturfing
anti-Soros editorials</a> and when it <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html">ignored
its own facilitation of genocide</a>
against the Rohingya in Myanmar. I have seen the systemic forces that prevent
either organization to do more than marginally better. Facebook even <a
href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjbpd7/how-facebook-is-stoking-a-civil-war-in-ethiopia">managed
to facilitate another genocide</a>, this time in Ethiopia.</p>

<p>One episode from my five years at Goldman is particularly instructive here:
During my last year at the firm, I was tasked with improving a trade control,
i.e., the combination of automated mechanism and human procedure intended to
ensure that no transaction runs counter firm policy, industry regulation, or
sovereign law. After some initial conversations with stakeholders, I was very
much concerned about the long-term effectiveness of supervisors manually
reviewing weekly emails with lists of a dozen or more transactions. That concern
barely scratched the surface, but it already was too much for everyone else.
After not even two weeks on the project, I was reassigned to a different one
that kept me busy writing software against well-defined technical
requirements.</p>


<aside class=pullquote>
<p>My remit was to provide the illusion of due diligence, no less, no more</p>
</aside>


<p>It took me until well after I left the firm to realize my mistake: I had
taken my remit literally and tried to actually improve a trade control that had
failed for two years without anyone noticing. I couldn’t have been more wrong.
My actual remit was to provide the illusion of due diligence and some
ostentatious action that didn’t change anything substantial but would allow the
responsible parties, technology management and Internal Audit, to check off the
necessary boxes and hence have plausible deniability. No less, no more.</p>

<p>That is just what Isaacson delivered with his biography of Musk, an illusion
of due diligence, which has no chance to really change anything about the <i
lang=la>status quo</i>. Given the substantial ground that left uncovered,
Isaacson’s failure is a first-rate tragedy that leaves even the chorus weeping.
So please do not waste your money on this book. It is irrelevant. It is an
abject failure of journalism that, warts and all, ends up as yet another ode to
greatness, where none is to be had.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear: The future of humanity is not in space including Mars. There
is <a
href="https://aeon.co/essays/we-will-never-be-able-to-live-on-another-planet-heres-why">no
planet B</a>. The sooner we accept this basic truth, the better our chances for
surviving this century. One small but critical step along that path is to
finally, truly, emphatically “put a stake in the ‘great man‘ biography” (quoting
the title of <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-09-11/lets-put-a-stake-in-the-great-man-biography-starting-with-isaacsons-elon-musk">Brian
Merchant’s review</a>).</p>

<hr>

<p>At this point, the angry, pitchfork-wielding part of me would love nothing
more than to drive Mr Pointy into Musk just where most people have a heart.
Alas, I’m no Buffy and dispensing monsters just doesn’t work like that in
manifest reality. Nonetheless, this article <em>is</em> an exorcism of sorts.
I’ve been been growing tired of Musk’s Trumpian omnipresence for a while now. So
my sincere hope is that, by comprehensively covering him this once, his hold
over my attention will significantly diminish. It <a
href="https://apparebit.com/features/ubu-trump">worked when I wrote about
Trump</a>. So why not for Musk?</p>

<p>For this exorcism to work, I need to make the case that Musk is a monster
indeed and not the genius inventor so many tech bros believe he is. I already
suggested one possible answer by repeatedly pointing to parallels between Musk
and Trump. The ability to insert himself into almost any situation and to make
it about himself, the frequent use of pithy posts on X née Twitter, the apparent
sympathies for far-right ideology and ideologues, a public persona that blends
mercurial, vindictive, and plain nuts, the insatiable hunger for external
validation, and the utter contempt for other humans. It all strongly reminds of
Trump.</p>

<p>Farrow even got two other great men who previously worked with Musk to attest
to Musk’s boundless narcissism. First, former PayPal <abbr>COO</abbr> and
LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman described Musk as having an attitude “like
Louis XIV: ‘<i lang=fr>L’état, c’est moi</i>.’ ” Second, Sam Altman,
<abbr>CEO</abbr> of Open&shy;AI, which was <a
href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai">co-founded
and funded by Musk</a>, stated that “Elon desperately wants the world to be
saved. But only if he can be the one to save it.” However, Altman’s quote
already hints at Musk being strictly more than Trump. At least, I can’t imagine
Trump giving any thought to the future of the world. More importantly, where
Trump’s businesses are largely forgettable, Musk
<em>has</em> made his mark on electric cars and space rockets. That’s a
meaningful difference.</p>

<p>Another possible explanation are the many and extreme ways Musk and his firms
try to maximize their own economic advantage. For Tesla alone, there are its
range grift, its insistence on only using video cameras despite an industry-wide
consensus to the contrary, its exorbitant pricing of what really is an immature
beta feature, and its complete lack of respect for customer privacy. Out of
these, the driving range grift is obviously unacceptable. But the bet on video
will have the most impact in the long run—with failure is measured in human
injuries and deaths.</p>

<p>While I cannot and will not exclude the possibility that this is a maverick
engineering choice, financial self-interest and disregard for others can explain
the choice just as well. This summer’s <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/a-reporter-at-large/the-titan-submersible-was-an-accident-waiting-to-happen">implosion
of the <cite>Titan</cite> submersible</a> off the coast of Newfoundland serves
as graphic reminder for the potential downsides of such maverick engineering
choices and the lack of a safety-first culture. Furthermore, Tesla’s record
raises uncomfortable questions about SpaceX and its safety culture. All of this
is deeply concerning and much of it is deserving of regulatory, legal, and
possibly criminal intervention. At the same time, Musk isn’t the only one with
this psychopathic need for out-doing everyone else, no matter the consequences.
For instance, Zuckerberg <a
href="https://apparebit.com/blog/2022/zuckerberg-lies">demonstrably lied in
Congressional testimony</a> and his firm has been <a
href="https://apparebit.com/blog/2022/wrong-impression">inflating advertising
metrics for its own benefits</a>. In short, self-enrichment <i lang=de>über
Alles</i> doesn’t turn Musk into a uniquely monstrous oligarch either.</p>

<p>My mention of Zuckerberg, however, does point us into the right direction.
Musk like the before-mentioned Altman, Hoffman, and Zuckerberg are all founders.
Like Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella,
Musk also runs one of the bigger corporations in technology. Admittedly, the
title of founder doesn’t currently have the cachet it had just a few years ago.
The toxic excesses of Uber’s Travis Kalanick and WeWork’s Adam Neumann certainly
contributed. Airbnb’s Joe Gebbia and Pinterest’s Ben Silbermann stepping down
just when economic conditions get tough didn’t help. Neither is Zuckerberg
keeping his <abbr>CEO</abbr> and President of the Board titles only thanks to
some funny business with vote allocation—with a majority of shareholders that
aren’t Zuckerberg voting to strip him of at least one title in <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/31/facebook-shareholder-meeting-mark-zuckerberg">2018</a>,
<a
href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/30/ahead-of-todays-shareholders-meeting-calls-to-fire-zuck-and-break-up-facebook/">2019</a>,
<a href="https://www.corpgov.net/2020/05/facebook-2020-shareholders-request-equal-votes/">2020</a>,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/facebook-board-rejects-proposals-to-reduce-zuckerberg-s-power">2021</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ft.com/content/0f4c676c-56a6-4b5e-850f-ddb78f9feb40">2022</a>,
and <a
href="https://observer.com/2023/06/mark-zuckerberg-2023-shareholder-meeting/">2023</a>.

<p>But unfortunately Zuckerberg and the rest of the founders and industry titans
are not going away. After all, they dominate the technology industry. They also
are mostly straight, mostly White, mostly American, all filthy rich (albeit at
different levels of filth), and all men, <em>great men</em>. That is consistent
with the extreme gender bias of the industry and nicely captured by the term
“tech bro.” It also reflects the prevailing reward system, which reserves most
of the spoils from success for investors and startup founders, with some smaller
fraction going to early employees.</p>


<aside class=pullquote>
<p>An industry obsessed with disruption managed to disrupt even biological
procreation</p>
</aside>


<p>Successful founders often go on to become venture capitalists or
<abbr>VC</abbr>s, who are responsible for selecting the next generation of
candidates for becoming great men. That way, startups led by men and funded by
venture capital become self-selecting and self-replicating, with great men
producing great men. Apparently, an industry obsessed with disruption managed to
disrupt biological procreation as well.</p>

<p>Given this extreme bias towards (a certain kind of) men, I am going to call
this system, tongue only slightly in cheek, <em class=score>Patriarchy 2.0</em>.
Compared to the original, v2 did manage some improvements. Its focus on merit
does make it more permeable and hence open to arbitrary comers—as long as they
are men. It also is more accepting of sexual and ethnic minorities, with Altman
and Cook both openly gay, Nadella and Pichai both openly Indian. At the same
time, v2 also adds even more shortcomings. Notably, the focus on merit becomes a
powerful excuse for not addressing structural problems and hence entrenches both
chauvinistic bias and extreme income inequality. The cult of the founder, with
its borderline religious qualities, serves to further ossify this grotesquely
unrepresentative system.</p>

<p>Elon Musk not only stands amongst the great men of this industry but is the
by far most extreme. He is not only White but was born and raised in apartheid
South Africa, i.e., white supremacist dystopia. He isn’t just straight but
exceedingly virile, having fathered eleven children so far. He is richer than
anyone else on Earth. He not only founded several companies (some of them only
in his imagination) but claims the most concurrent <abbr>CEO</abbr> and
<abbr>CTO</abbr> titles. Finally, he is not only the most abrasive but outright
cruelest amongst the bunch. In that, he easily surpasses Kalanick’s and
Neumann’s toxicity, not that it makes any difference for his control over his
conglomerate of firms. Those are some impressive outliers even when compared to
his outlying peers. That seems positively monstrous to me.</p>

<hr>

<p>Given the technology industry’s focus on merit, it seems only fair that we
evaluate the overall merit of <span class=score>Patriarchy 2.0</span> and its
great men. In the interest of bringing this article to its conclusion, I am
going to limit myself to three, relatively coarse but critical criteria only,
value added to our lives, the industry’s relevance to meeting the needs of
society, and the overall legitimacy of its great men. For each of these
criteria, I’ll provide a narrative summary and then score industry performance
on the <a href="https://pitchfork.com">Pitchfork</a> scale from <span
class=score>0.0</span> to <span class=score>10.0</span>. On the site, scores
around <span class=score>7.0</span> are fairly typical, i.e., middling. <a

<span class=score>10.0</span> are far and few between</a>. <a
href="https://slate.com/culture/2018/05/when-a-negative-pitchfork-review-could-end-a-career.html">The
same holds for <span class=score>0.0</span></a>.</p>


<h3>Value-Add</h3>

<p>The technology industry has certainly been exceedingly disruptive,
fundamentally changing how we read news or books, listen to music, watch movies,
shop, pay bills, find dates, communicate, and so on. As computing technology has
become ubiquitous, network and platform effects have deeply entrenched the
biggest players, Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Typically, two or
three of them control a segment of the market. For instance, Apple and Microsoft
own desktop operating systems, while Apple and Google own handheld operating
systems. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft dominate cloud services. Meta controls
much of social networking but shares online advertising with Google.</p>

<p>Overall, the record of the big five is distinctly mixed. Microsoft seems the
most benign and undistinguished of late. Though its <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/microsofts-complex-bet-on-openai-brings-potential-and-uncertainty.html">$13
billion investment into OpenAI</a> suggests that it was just hibernating and
badly wants to dominate in <abbr>AI</abbr>. By comparison, Amazon and Apple have
a more clearly problematic record. Notably, the price for Amazon’s famed
customer friendliness are warehouses that are so ruthlessly optimized they have
made workers entirely disposable and churn through them at frightening rates.
The firm projects it will <a
href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23170900/leaked-amazon-memo-warehouses-hiring-shortage">run
out of people to hire for its warehouses in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apple has taken price gouging to new extremes. The
16 <abbr>GB</abbr> upgrade for its latest laptops costs $400. However, the
<em>most expensive</em> module of equal capacity I could find for a
<abbr>PC</abbr> is $27. Yet Apple charges 15× as much. It doesn’t end there.
Apple justifies its exclusive stranglehold over its iOS app store as a necessity
for security and privacy. But its app review lacks transparency, is often
arbitrary, and obviously designed to maximizing the reach of its usurious 30%
cut on transactions. Yet as the <cite>Post</cite> put it two years ago, the app
store also “<a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/06/apple-app-store-scams-fraud/">is
teeming with scams</a>.”


<aside class=pullquote>
<p>It never is a good idea to model one’s business on East Germany’s Stasi</p>
</aside>


<p>It only gets worse: Google and Meta innovated alright. Their business model,
surveillance capitalism, is predicated on aggressively collecting and analyzing
data about us and to then precision-target ads on us. The result has been a
complete erosion of our privacy. Much of the web is now littered with ads, which
may creepily follow from site to site. It never is a good idea to model one’s
business on East Germany’s Stasi, which ruthlessly surveilled that country’s
citizens the old-fashioned way, with human informants, lots of informants, <a
href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/koehler-stasi.html">one
informant per 6.5 citizens</a>. Not only does such surveillance invite
governmental abuse, it enables <a
href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31692">financial fraud</a> and other forms of
extortion, as illustrated by the aforementioned case of the gay Catholic priest.
But such considerations haven’t stopped Google, Meta, and many other firms from
embracing surveillance capitalism. Amazon does it. Apple does it. <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/technology/instacart-public-ads.html">Instacart,
a grocer, does it</a>. The Western branch of the Chinese Communist Party
<abbr>aka</abbr> TikTok does it. In short, the “<a
href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshittification</a>”
of the technology industry has reached levels that would put the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augeas">Augean stables</a>
to shame.</p>

<p>There are huge variations in value-add, so giving one letter grade to the
industry seems fundamentally unfair. Instead I score Google and Meta separately
for their pioneering embrace of surveillance capitalism. It is suitably ironic
that said innovation largely was the responsibility of a, <em>drum roll</em>,
woman. Sheryl Sandberg nurtured the advertising team at Google into existence
and then went onto Facebook, where she outdid herself many times over including
by serving as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain">Brain</a>
to Mr Zuckerberg’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain">Pinky</a>. How’s that
for moral clarity: Silicon Valley’s chauvinistic leadership and reward system is
deeply problematic, but a female executive can also have pernicious global
impact.</p>

<p class=score><em>Value-Add</em>: Google and Meta 0.9; Industry 6.9</p>


<h3>Relevance</h3>

<p>When it comes to the defining challenge of our times, climate change, the
technology industry is missing in action. In fact, the industry seems to only
obsess about technologies that excell at energy consumption. For many years,
tech bros’ crypto mania consumed obscene amounts of energy, for example, <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html">besting
the Netherlands for energy consumption in 2021</a>. Now that the bubble has
popped and most players have gone bankrupt, one hopes that electricity
consumption collapsed at least as much as asset prices. There also might be
important lessons about risk management, controls, and compliance when trading
speculative digital assets. But nah… The industry has long moved onto the next
big thing, <abbr>AI</abbr>, and training machine learning models requires large
amounts of electricity. For instance, GPT-3 <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/how-much-energy-do-ai-and-chatgpt-use-no-one-knows-for-sure">consumed
as much energy during training as 120 <abbr>US</abbr> households</a> do during
an entire year—and <abbr>US</abbr> households have a voracious appetite for
energy when compared to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>While some parts of the industry are doing their best to accelerate climate
change, others seem a tad less insane and focus on improving sustainability—or
at least the parts of sustainability that do not interfere with a firm’s profit.
In other words, they would rather virtue-signal about sustainability than make
the hard choices to make products that plainly last longer. For instance, just
last month, Apple made a big splash and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNv9PRDIhes">a terrible comedy sketch</a>
about its sustainability efforts, introducing its first carbon-neutral product,
a watch, and phasing out leather for its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. That’s nice,
but also major gaslighting because the firm didn’t change much about how it
pushes people towards buying new devices as often as possible. Almost all of the
firm’s devices have few if any replacable parts, with components generally
soldered or glued down. As a result, they are very hard to repair and impossible
to upgrade or extend. On top of that, the firm’s liberal use of planned
obsolescence leaves people with unsupported devices far too soon. For example,
the just released macOS 14.0 drops support for four-year-old laptops.</p>

<p>There is one big-ish firm, however, that might just make a real difference,
Tesla. Not only has it been selling their own battery-operated cars. But that
has also encouraged the car industry to follow in its footsteps. Alas, I wrote
“might” for two good reasons: First, Tesla changes nothing about our dependence
on individual transport when what’s really needed are more communitarian
options, such as trains. Second, whatever reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
Tesla achieves, <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220713-how-to-make-rocket-launches-less-polluting">SpaceX
counteracts</a> by emitting not only CO<sub>2</sub> but also soot and by
damaging Earth’s critical ozone layer. At the same time, SpaceX also launches
satellites monitoring the impact from climate change. In short, before
acknowledging Tesla, I’d like to see a comprehensive accounting of SpaceX’s
impact.</p>

<p>As to the rest of the industry, it sure looks like they place more emphasis
on short-term profits than on the long-term survival of human civilization.
There is a small and influential cottage industry of doomsayers within the
industry. But they are mostly concerned about abstract, future risks, such as
<abbr>AGI</abbr> going SkyNet (i.e., that an <abbr>AI</abbr> capable of
independent reasoning will exterminate humanity), and somehow just can’t
acknowledge climate change as the all-overriding threat it really is. Then
again, they also have some rather strange ideas about humanity’s future.
Notably, they take for granted that all of us will be somehow digitized and live
happily after in a computer simulation. Ok, “rather strange” is too mild.
Batshit crazy is more like it.</p>

<p>The thing is: All the big corporations have a pretty detailed picture of all
the suffering climate change will bring to us over the next twenty years. While
I worked for Meta, I got my hands on a study the firm commissioned from a
climate consultancy. They evaluated the risks from climate change for all of
Meta’s locations, including engineering offices, data centers, and sales offices
(plus strangely a number of locations in China even though Meta’s social
networks are blocked there) along six axes. They are heat stress, water stress,
floods, cyclones, sea level rise, and wildfires. The consultancy conveniently
color coded the background of the per-location risk scores, forming a gradient
from green meaning no extra risk to red meaning extreme risk.</p>

<p>The only consistent green on the pages with the risk scores is for
non-coastal locations having no risk from sea level rise. The vast majority of
scores are at least yellow, with dark orange and red gradations dominating the
report. I was so depressed the day after reading this report I simply couldn’t
get out of bed. The fact that Meta still allows Republicans to spread their
insidious lies denying climate change just shows how much of a psychopath and
loser Zuckerberg is. Utterly pathetic!</p>

<p>I can only think of only one industry that is even worse than the technology
industry, namely the oil and gas industry. Since Tesla is exceptional, it gets
its own score. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry’s lack of relevance is just
unacceptable. Fail!</p>

<p class=score><em>Relevance</em>: Tesla 8.4; Industry 3.3</p>


<h3>Legitimacy</h3>

<p>For evaluating the legitimacy of the technology industry’s great men, I am
going to focus on Elon Musk. He simultaneously serves as <abbr>CEO</abbr> of
Tesla and SpaceX as well as <abbr>CTO</abbr> of SpaceX and X. He clearly makes
time for his incessant trolling on X. He also has a rather active sex life, with
multiple partners, and appears to have a drug habit. I am not mentioning the
latter two to shame Musk. Furthermore, I find Farrow’s speculation about
ketamine as possbile explanation for Musk’s behavior reductive and not helpful.
If the drug helps him unwind, then good for him. My point is much simpler: All
of these things take time, significant time.</p>

<p>That makes any notion that Musk is single-handedly responsible for designing
and building electric cars, space rockets, tunnel boring machines, brain
computer interfaces, artificial intelligence systems, satellite communication
systems, and so on utterly laughable. The guy obviously hasn’t even participated
in a code review in twenty years. Instead of Musk, almost all of the work at all
these companies is the work of countless engineers who apparently have a higher
tolerance for abuse than I will ever have.</p>

<p>But once we acknowledge that the actual work is almost exclusively performed
by legions of other people, then our hero worship of Musk and all the other tech
bros is entirely misplaced. Furthermore, an economic system that that awards
these great men far more than everyone else isn’t just deeply unjust but utterly
exploitative. There also is the question of how to account for the industry’s
negative externalities. Close to a million Rohingya continue to live in squalor
in this planet’s densest settlement, the <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-27/how-the-rohingya-refugee-camp-turned-into-a-city">Kutupalong
refugee camp in Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh</a>. They are the survivors of the
first genocide facilitated by Facebook. If Zuckerberg and other Meta employees
had to pay reparations, as they should, their wealth might just be gone.</p>

<p>When Heracles cleaned the Augean stables in a day by redirecting two rivers,
arguably a clever solution to an impossible challenge, he nonetheless failed the
challenge because he didn’t do the work himself. He also failed the challenge of
slaying the nine-headed Hydra of Lerna. Not because he didn’t slay her. He sure
did. He failed because he had his nephew Iolaus help him. Yet Silicon Valley’s
great men have achieved much lesser feats only with help of thousands upon
thousands of anonymous engineers. Yet they demand to be treated like Heracles.
That’s not how it worked in Ancient times.</p>

<p>That’s not how it should work today. To begin with, Heracles successfully
completed ten other challenges and thus possibly deserved the adoration. But if
you read the story of his challenges or labors, the one thing that sticks out is
that he is nothing but a mass-murderer who, to atone for killing wife and
children, goes out and kills and kills and kills. That surely is not the way to
make amends for anything. The lesson couldn’t be clearer: <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/t-magazine/gay-villains-white-lotus-ripley.html">These
great men are trying to murder us</a>. Ok, I wrote that last sentence tongue
firmly in cheek. But given that the technology industry’s leaders are mostly
white, mostly straight, mostly American, filthy rich men, with a history of
ethically dubious behavior to maximize their riches, what are the chances that
they will build <abbr>AI</abbr> systems that are aligned with the needs of all
of us?</p>

<p>I’d say, that’s a big fat zero!</p>

<p>That also is our final score for the legitimacy of these great men. It
accounts for their astounding egotism and sleaze, with additional points
subtracted for delusional claims of actual greatness where none is to be had. In
their illegitimacy, they also are all the same. No one deserves a separate score
because no-one meets basic standards of decency.</p>

<p class=score><em>Legitimacy</em>: Industry 0.0</p>

<hr>

<p>To recap, the technology industry is middling at best when it comes to
creating value for others. With possible exception of Tesla, the industry also
fails to meet the defining challenge of our times. Its leaders suffer from a
complete lack of legitimacy, claiming contributions they had only cursory
involvement in. Clearly, <span class=score>Patriarchy 2.0</span> isn’t any
better than the original version. Hence the industry’s great men are wholly
deserving of our disdain and disgust. They also are in urgent need of disruption
and disintermediation.</p>

<p>Truth be told, Silicon Valley’s great men don’t even make for good
anti-heroes. They are too bland, too boring, too devoid of the qualities that
make humans human. In a pinch, Elon Musk is the only one who might qualify. But
when you watch him trolling on X, it’s impossible to escape the impression that
he is plainly pathetic and just a major asshole. In calling him just that,
Isaacson got one thing really right. Kudos for putting it in print!</p>

<hr>

<p>It’s not just the megalomania, which really isn’t backed by any discernable
achievement but having too much money. It’s not just the sleazy and extralegal
business practices. It’s not just the amateurish meddling in <abbr>US</abbr>
foreign policy. It’s not just the far-right trolling and the cosplaying with
fascism lite. It is fundamentally about humans and their dignity. If you can’t
respect that, you shouldn’t have power over other people. It’s as simple as
that. Yet the great men of the technology industry have an abysmal record when
it comes to respecting others’ humanity.</p>

<p>Just like Zuckerberg is complicit in two genocides and Bezos thought it
acceptable to use up (often Black and Brown) warehouse workers, Musk disposes of
people at will. A couple of days ago, the federal government’s <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/29/tesla-lawsuit-harassment-racism-black-employees-california">Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission sued Tesla</a> because “Black workers at the
Tesla plant in Fremont have routinely been subjected to racist slurs and
graffiti, including swastikas and nooses.” So far, five women who used to work
at SpaceX, have <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/22831380/spacex-employees-harassment-workplace-misconduct-elon-musk">come
forward describing pervasive sexual harassment</a>. Then there is the flight
attendant who <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-paid-250000-to-a-flight-attendant-who-accused-elon-musk-of-sexual-misconduct-2022-5">detailed
how Musk exposed himself</a> to her before propositioning her.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you read through this article and still harbor a tech bro crush on Elon
Musk, it’s time to do the work and rid yourself of this false idol. I’ve
assembled a reasonable overview of his record. You know all you need to know.
The bottom line is that he’s just another racist, chauvinistic, and abusive man.
So stop with the hero worship and start living your own story. Sure, you
probably won’t get as close to omnipotence as Musk and you will miss out on all
that oligarchic cosplay. But when somebody treats other humans as disposable,
they are the worst kind of monster. More importantly, anyone can be a greedy,
misanthropic creep. That’s no achievement at all. Doing right by other humans is
far harder and far more rewarding. So give it a try. It just might grow on you!
(And yeah, you can still troll on X, but please keep it to once or twice a
month.)</p>

<p>If you are a woman who has the misfortune to work in this industry and were
nodding along for most of this last section but thinking “I knew that years
ago,” my sincere apologies. Occasionally, I’m a little slow catching on.
Usually, I’m much better. I’m also looking for a new opportunity to build
technology that focuses on creating human value for all of us. If you need a
clever engineer to help with that, <a href="mailto:apparebit@gmail.com">hit me
