<p>It is with inconsolable sadness and heartbreak that the royal household is
announcing the passing of King Arthur. He was grey, standing between the candle
and the star. Thanks to Him, we were grey, standing between the darkness and the
light. But now there is only darkness!</p>

<p>We shall forever miss His serene beauty and elegant poise, which brought
glory to the royal household. We shall forever miss His mysterious vibrations,
which reached deep into every subjectâ€™s cells and had miraculous yet proven
healing powers. We shall forever miss His meow, carefully and sparingly employed
for altogether heightened effect and urgency. We were grey. But now there is
only darkness!</p>

<p>We shall forever miss His targeted expression of displeasure, which would
vanquish keyboards, mattresses, and comforters into the afterlife without
warning or notice. We shall forever miss His liquid fury, which only the
application of Natureâ€™s Miracle by the gallon could appease. We were grey. But
now there is only darkness!</p>

<p>We shall forever miss His most gentle, kind, and wise rule over His domain,
which brought life-saving stability in turbulent times. We shall forever miss
His affection for us subjects, whom He was always willing to grace with a rub or
snuggle. His absence will be especially hard on feet and shoes, who benefited
tremendously from His most generous adoration. We were grey. But now there is
only darkness!</p>

<p>We shall forever miss lying down to sleep and feeling His lithe jump onto bed
and pitter-patter across, His purr-some kneading of the comforter and curling up
at our side, and finally His unwavering rest until the morning stirs. Without
Him, only the emptiness of restless nights beckons. We were grey. But now there
is only darkness!</p>

<p>In lieu of wreaths and other gestures of commiseration, the royal household
respectfully asks for a donation in King Arthurâ€™s name to your local no-kill
shelter. We were grey. But now there is only darkness!</p>

<p>Pie Jesu Domine, dona ei requiem.</p>
