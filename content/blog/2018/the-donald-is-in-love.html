<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>Last Saturday, at one of those campaign revival rallies that make him feel so
alive because it’s all about me me me, President Trump shared the following
happy news with his angry white male supporters and thereby the rest of
us:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-trump/we-fell-in-love-trump-swoons-over-letters-from-north-koreas-kim-idUSKCN1MA03Q">
  <p>I was really tough and so was he, and we were going back and forth. And
      then, we fell in love. OK? No, really. He wrote me beautiful letters, and
      they’re great letters. We fell in love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. What incredible news! Let me start by congratulating the happy couple of
Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Mazel tov! I cannot but be astounded by the
glorious union between the duly elected president of the United States and the
supreme leader of North Korea, who is third in a family dynasty of ruthlessly
murderous dictators with communist veneer.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=a-history-with-rough-trade>
<h2 id=a-history-with-rough-trade>A History with Rough Trade</h2>

<p>Admittedly, it wasn’t entirely unexpected. The Donald has consistently
demonstrated a soft spot for conniving and murderous strong men of the worst
kind. After all, it was another of that sort, our beloved president of Russia
Vladimir Putin, who helped install him in the White House in the first place.
But even if we disregard the Donald’s attraction to this roughest of rough
trade, we could have seen it coming if only we had known where to look.</p>

<p>After all, the kindling of this queerest of all love affairs was all out
there in the open. First were the rhetorical fireworks promising “fire and fury
like the world has never seen” (Trump). At the time, the threat of ending the
world in nuclear armageddon really was believable and rather frightening. I sure
stocked up on potassium iodine tablets. But now we know that it only served as
pretext for the exchange of pet names. Jong-un picked the rather descriptive
“mentally deranged <abbr>US</abbr> dotard,” whereas the Donald went with the
very rock ’n’ roll “rocket man.” I mean who doesn’t just adore Sir Elton John?
She makes great music, knows every bold faced name, and is just so cuddly and
colorful. You go, girl!</p>

<p>Next came the summit between the future lovebirds in Singapore. The Donald
showed up with his own Riefenstahl movie, which he had commissioned for just the
occasion and which literally promised the world. For once, the Donald also kept
a promise because he (figuratively) did hand Jong-un the world. Before the
summit, nobody would talk to, let alone invite, the “crazy fat kid” from the
hermit kingdom (John McCain being his maverick self — may he rest in a North
Korean prison camp). Now people the world over pay close attention to the man
who came in from the Korea. Though Jong-un still doesn’t get those coveted first
row seats at the fashion shows in Paris. Give it time, dear respected leader.
Give it time!</p>

<p>But then after Singapore it got awfully quiet. We pinko snowflakes from the
reality-based community thought that was because the summit was big on symbolism
and carefully staged photo ops but entirely devoid of actual summiting — with
warmed up memoranda from twenty years ago sold as the latest in Pyongyang style.
But no, it was just that the Donald and Jong-un had moved on to a more intimate
phase of their courtship.</p>

<p>As the great tweetator so proudly revealed to an incredulous world, the two
of them were engaged in that most traditional of courtship rituals, the intimate
letter discretely delivered by confidants. It really is quite inspiring how the
Donald — a grand master of that highest of art forms of angry straight white
men, the attack tweet — turns warm and fuzzy when it comes to the customs of
bourgeois society long destroyed by capitalism in its most destructive and
inhuman form. Sadly, the effects seem to wear off rather quickly. Only hours
after coming out as in love with Jong-un, the Donald remarked to a female
reporter: “You are not thinking. You never do!”</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=three-threats>
<h2 id=three-threats>Three Deadly Threats</h2>

<p>I don’t want to rain in on the lovebirds’ parade, but I have three concerns
that each may turn into existential threats to the relationship in no time.
Besides the parade would have to be in Pyongyang anyways — the <abbr>US</abbr>
military has already rejected one for Washington <abbr>DC</abbr> — and I don’t
fancy traveling to that drab holdover of Soviet inspired megalomania cast in
concrete just to attend some stupid parade. But back to my three concerns.</p>

<p>First, the Donald has clearly outdone himself with his fourth life partner,
seeing that the 72 year old is entering a bonafide May December relationship
with a 27 year old. That is bound to cause significant friction between them. I
mean which man in his late twenties or early thirties wants to be stuck at home
changing his aging lover’s adult diapers, especially when he is a murderous
spoilt brat and could instead be out there blackmailing the rest of the world
with the treat of nuclear annihilation. Worse, the extreme age difference —
roughly double the already pronounced 24 years between Donald and Melania — puts
an unavoidable expiration date of about a decade on Donald’s and Jong-un’s
future together — if all goes well that is.</p>

<p>Second, there is Melania. As far as we know, the Donald has not yet handed
her divorce papers. She probably first heard about her husband’s new lover when
we first heard about him, on <abbr>TV</abbr>. That alone is sufficient to turn
any woman into a fury out to teach her philandering hubby the respect women
deserve but so many men can’t be bothered to show.</p>

<p>But Melania had to endure months of her husband’s past conquests being
plastered all over the news. In fact, for  a while, you couldn’t turn on cable
news without watching a segment with Stormy Daniels, a porn actress the Donald
boinked the same weekend he also boinked a Playboy bunny. Melania spent that
particular weekend at home changing the diapers of the couple’s newborn son. So
it is no surprise that she is already on edge and publicly trolling her husband
in her role as First Lady by campaigning against cyber-bullying. Add his very
public revelation of a much younger, male lover and you have the recipe for a
very acrimonious divorce!</p>

<p>Third, there always is the question of each partner’s families and their
relationships. At first glance, there are significant parallels. The Donald runs
both his real estate company fronting for a Russian money laundering operation
and the United States government as a family affair. Sons Don Jr and Eric are
taking care of the private Russian interests, whereas daughter Ivanka and
son-in-law Jared are taking care of Russian state interests — plus opening new
avenues of corruption with China and Arab oil states.</p>

<p>Comparably, Jong-un not only is third in a direct family line of North Korean
dictators, he also relies on the support of his aunt Kim Kyong-hui and sister
Kim Yo-jong in high ranking government positions that control propaganda,
security forces, and the army. Yet worryingly for the Donald’s children, Jong-un
has not been averse to having family members executed or murdered, lest they
become a threat to his regime. For that reason, both the above mentioned aunt’s
husband and Jong-un’s half brother died an early violent death. Granted, most
people including those currently working in the White House wouldn’t miss Ivanka
and Jared if they suddenly vanished. But despite the Donald’s failings being
legion, I am confident that he would be quite upset upon finding out about such
a horrible eventuality.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=critical-distinction>
<h2 id=critical-distinction>A Critical Distinction</h2>

<p>So before this all gets too macabre, let’s congratulate the two lovebirds
Donald and Jong-un again as well as hope and pray for the couple’s future. With
all that said and done, the only thing that still needs to be stated is the
following: Do not even think of calling the lovebirds gay. They are not. Really,
they are so not gay. They are two straight men in an utterly perverted and
disgusting relationship. Granted, Roy Cohn and Peter Thiel, the former and
current holders of the most vilest gay title, are on us. But Donald Trump and
Kim Jong-un are on you straight people. Are we clear?!</p>
