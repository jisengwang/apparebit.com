<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>In late 2020, we started having difficulties with the installation of Python
packages.</p>

<p>At times, the default package manager for Python, <code>pip</code>, would
take hours for what used to take seconds. Worse, it might just refuse to install
the packages altogether, with an error message indicating a version
conflict.</p>

<p>With 15 applications and 19 internal libraries in our small business data
processing pipeline, all of them written in Python and spread out over as many
git repositories, humans and machines alike need to install packages with
reasonable regularity — the humans to develop new versions of the code, and the
machines to create container images for deployment to production, typically as
part of continuous integration.</p>

<p>It wasn’t too difficult to identify the proximate cause for this highly
unusual slowdown. Version 20.3 of <code>pip</code> had been released on <time
datetime=2020-11-30>November 30, 2020</time> and included a change of package
resolution algorithm. The previous and fundamentally unsound “pick pretty much
any version” algorithm was now disabled by default and marked for removal in a
future version. Its replacement treated version constraints as gospel truth and
refused to install dependencies when those version constraints were in conflict.
That there were version conflicts in our codebase wasn’t surprising. After all,
the version constraints appearing in manifests had never been validated for
global consistency. Hence it was unavoidable that this transition would be
somewhat rough.</p>

<p>It didn’t help that the <code>pip</code> team buried the news about switching
to the new package resolver as default: it is the second-to-last item in the
list of features updated for the <a
href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v20-3b1">preceding beta release
20.3b1</a>. Furthermore, with a public preview period of only four months, the
<code>pip</code> team made the switch too early. The resolver was still prone to
exhaustively exploring versions that would never satisfy the constraints. It
also contained at least <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/">19 bugs
and shortcomings</a> that were then fixed over the following twelve months —
compared to 14 that were fixed during the preview period.</p>

<p>A further source of confusion was that most engineers use the version of
<code>pip</code> bundled with Python’s standard library. That makes the version
of <code>pip</code> used to install packages dependent on the version of Python
used to run code, while also introducing a significant delay until any given
version of <code>pip</code> becomes widely used. Notably, if you are using
Python 3.7 (as some of us still do) and ignore the <code>pip</code> warning
exhorting you to upgrade, you are still using the old resolver to this day. If
you are using Python 3.8 (as some of us also do), then the release of Python
3.8.10 on <time datetime=2021-05-03>May 3, 2021</time>
fundamentally changed how you install Python packages. The apparent disregard in
all this for established versioning conventions is striking. Making backwards
incompatible changes in a new minor version (<code>pip</code> 20.3) or in a new
patch version (Python 3.8.10) is a big no-no under <a
href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> and not helpful.</p>

<p>As exasperated tales about <code>pip</code>’s misbehavior multiplied in our
daily standup meetings, it became clear that we needed to start a concerted
effort towards cleaning up our package requirements. At the same time, we had
little insight into the scope of the clean up, i.e., the number of packages with
conflicting versions as well as the number of conflicting constraints for each
conflicted package. So I found myself tasked with producing just that survey in
<time datetime=2021-10>October 2021</time>.</p>

<p>Alas, I couldn’t be bothered with the tedium of manually surveying 34
repositories for their requirements. So I decided to write a Python script for
doing the survey and thereby set off on a journey into the wondrous world of
package management.</p>

<p>The exploration revealed that the world of package management is large,
covered in harsh terrain, and crawling with dragons.</p>

<p>At the same time, there are few maps of this world and they all suffer from
significant inaccuracies and omissions. So we decided to follow in the footsteps
of early map makers for Earth — Anaximander! Hecataeus of Miletus! Isidore of
Seville! — and map the world of package management more completely and
accurately, across a series of blog posts:</p>

<ol class="drop-count">

<li>This first post will give you a coarse overview map of package management,
describing common features found across most terrains and locating the largest
and most persistent dragon infestation found in this world. It also identifies
the other ferocious critters haunting Python’s package ecosystem, which goes
some way towards explaining that ecosystem’s dismal reputation.</li>

<li><a href="/blog/2022/your-own-kind-of-map">The second post</a> will argue for
maintaining your own custom maps and leveraging them to prevent dragon
infestations. It will chronicle the transformation of a simple script for
extracting package requirements from 34 version control repositories into a
checking tool that is based on the dragon-repellent design of Go’s package
manager and validates every merge request for those 34 repositories.</li>

<li>In <a href="/blog/2022/new-map-layers">the third post</a>, we’ll discuss two
additional map layers that are critical to understanding this world: the social
and economic considerations related to package management, which serve as
dragonbane and dragonwort, respectively.</li>

</ol>

<p>I hope that our map-making efforts help you to better navigate the world of
package management and avoid being attacked by dragons along the way. If our
maps fall short of that lofty goal, then please remember that the likes of
Anaximander (living in Miletus ca 600 <abbr>BCE</abbr>) and Isidore (living in
Seville 1,200 years later) got a lot wrong as well.</p>

<p>Such are the risks when mapping previously uncharted lands.</p>

<p>Whenever we find ourselves on a journey into new and uncharted lands, it
helps to draw a map. That way, we won’t get lost later on. For that to be the
case, the map must be sufficiently detailed as well as accurate. Otherwise, we
end up with a map like the T-O map by Isidore of Seville from 636
<abbr>CE</abbr>, shown above in its first printed version from 1472
<abbr>CE</abbr>. It clearly lacks detail. In fact, there isn’t any.</p>

</figure>

<p>At the same time, it isn’t as outlandishly inaccurate as you might think. If
you take an orthographic projection of Earth with Jerusalem at the center, draw
in the western half of the equator and the full meridian, rotate the map by 45º
counter-clockwise, you end up with the map shown on the right. Et voilà, the T-O
map is not that different from a modern map anymore.</p>

<p>Let’s return to package management and start by defining our terminology. A
<em>package</em> is an archive file that contains software that has been prepared
for distribution. That software may be a complete application or command line
tool, but quite often it only is a building block or <em>library</em>. Code may be
in either source or binary form and targets either a particular programming
language or operating system. Each package has a unique name and each
<em>release</em> of the package has a hierarchical <em>version number</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>As you already saw above on the examples of <code>pip</code> 20.3 and Python
3.8.10, the version number typically uses dots to separate the <em>major</em>,
<em>minor</em>, and <em>patch</em> numbers. In the case of Python 3.8.10 the
trailing zero is meaningful: this version is the eleventh patch release of
Python 3.8. Another software artifact <em>depends</em> on that package when it
may possibly execute some of its code. To do so, the artifact <em>requires</em>
the package by listing the dependency in its <em>manifest</em>. Each entry in
that manifest names the dependent package and optionally also includes
<em>constraints</em> on suitable package versions as well as the runtime
environment.</p>

<p>The <em>package manager</em> implements the mechanics of a package ecosystem.
Its primary two functions are to <em>publish</em> packages to some <em>package
registry</em> and to <em>install</em> the dependencies of a software artifact by
consulting that registry. Publishing a package requires a deliberate decision by
the package’s developers or <em>maintainers</em> that the current state of the
package’s code is worthy of consumption by others. The mechanics of publication
include creating the required manifest and archives as well as uploading them to
the registry.</p>

<p>Installing a package also requires a deliberate decision by the package’s
users to build on a package’s contents. However, most package managers support
the automatic installation of (some) package updates. The mechanics of
installation include picking satisfactory versions for all dependencies,
locating and downloading the corresponding archive files, validating their
cryptographic hashes to establish integrity, and putting their contents into the
right file system directories.</p>

<p>We can see why package managers have become so popular. They remove a lot of
friction from the process of publishing and consuming software components, while
also offering an embarrassment of riches in software packages for all use cases
and purposes. Gone are the days when, at least on Unix-like operating systems,
one had to search the internet for suitable code, locate a distribution mirror,
download the source archive, expand the contents into a working directory, and
execute the <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/GNU-Build-System.html"><abbr>GNU</abbr>
build system</a> incantation:</p>

<pre><code>./configure
make
make install
</code></pre>

<p>Hence it should be no surprise that package managers have become integral to
contemporary software engineering. However, since most commercial corporations
prefer not to share (all) their software with the commons, they typically
prevent direct access to the package registry and instead use a local proxy that
prevents external publication while also auditing the consumption of external
packages.</p>

<p>For example, Enigma maintains its own internal Python package registry that
is not accessible from outside the firm. That registry is used to publish
internal packages. It also proxies access to the Python Package Index serving as
public registry, which enables the 15 tasks and 19 internal libraries making up
our small business data pipeline to depend on 220 external packages, comprising
60 direct dependencies and the transitive closure of their dependencies.</p>

York Public Library / University of Rochester</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All that removal of friction comes at a price. The Hunt-Lenox Globe shown
above is kind enough to point out where the dragons are hiding. Sam Boyer, who
implemented most of the (by now deprecated) <code>dep</code> dependency manager
for Go, created the <a
href="https://medium.com/@sdboyer/so-you-want-to-write-a-package-manager-4ae9c17d9527">equivalent
blog post for package management</a>. He doesn’t just point to the dragons. He
warns us to stay away right at the start, titling the first section “Package
management is awful, you should quit right now.” — Ooh, a challenge? This will
be interesting and, yes, also fun! But we should still map out where all the
dragons and other nasty critters are hiding.</p>


<h3>The Dragon Boss: Installing Packages</h3>

<p>We’ll spend the rest of this post wrangling the biggest dragon related to
package management: installing packages. Fundamentally, it requires determining
the transitive closure of an application’s declared dependencies. That includes
the packages required by the application, the packages required by the packages
required by the application, and so on until a fixed point is reached. Doing so
is necessary just for functional completeness, so that the application has all
the code it might execute readily and locally available.</p>

<p>The package manager also needs to figure out the correct versions of all
packages to install. That is because any practical package ecosystem doesn’t
just distinguish between different packages, which usually have a descriptive
name, but also distinguishes between different versions of a package.
Accommodating different versions is necessary to accommodate ever-present
change. Versions are usually named by a three-part hierarchical number. For
example, Amazon recently released version 1.23.50 of its botocore Python library
for accessing <abbr>AWS</abbr>. Remember that the third, least significant
component of that version number is 50, i.e., the zero is meaningful and the
preceding version is 1.23.49.</p>

<p>When packages declare a requirement in their manifest, they provide a package
name, a comparison operator, and a version number. For instance, the requirement
“ <code>botocore &gt;= 1.19.21</code> ” indicates that the application or library
requires version 1.19.21 or later of the botocore package. As I described in a
<a href="/blog/2021/lets-try-again">previous blog post</a>, that is the first
version to include a fully working implementation of the adaptive retry logic,
which greatly simplifies the development of robust client code.</p>

<p>Now another library may also depend on botocore but specify “ <code>botocore
&gt;= 1.15.0</code> ” as a requirement. Now, since both requirements appear in
the transitive closure of dependencies, our package manager must pick a version
that meets both constraints — such as the larger of the two minima, which is
version 1.19.21. Conversely, if the constraints cannot be satisfied by a single
version, the package manager should report back with an error message that
clearly states the unsatisfiable constraints, so developers can adjust the
requirements.</p>

<p>Picking a suitable version is rarely as easy as in the above example. First,
determining the transitive closure of packages to install and resolving version
constraints interfere with each other: different versions of a package may
require different packages. Second, the problem of resolving version constraints
is <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00697463"><abbr>NP</abbr></a>-<a
href="https://research.swtch.com/version-sat">complete</a>. In other words,
version satisfiability is one of many problems that are equivalent to each other
and have no known efficient solution.</p>

<p>At the same time, that class of problems has another, more helpful
characteristic: when given a possible solution, we can efficiently verify
whether the candidate is in fact a solution. In a pinch, then, we have a general
but exponential time algorithm for computing a solution: enumerate all possible
solutions (the expensive part) and verify each one of them (the efficient part).
If a candidate holds up to scrutiny, we use that as the solution. If we run out
of candidates, there is no solution. At least, that’s the theory.</p>

<p>In practice, the dependency graphs formed by package requirements and their
version constraints often aren’t that big, and hence even that exhaustive search
remains computationally manageable. Also, there is nothing preventing us from
being clever and using heuristics that tend to produce a result sooner than
mindless enumeration (but won’t always work). Options include <a
href="https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv"><abbr>SAT</abbr> solvers</a>, which
solve the equivalent problem of boolean satisfiability and have gotten darn good
at doing so, in part thanks to <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/">yearly
competitions</a>, as well as <a
href="https://pubgrub-rs-guide.netlify.app/internals/intro.html">domain-specific
algorithms</a>.</p>

<p>Alas, practice cannot escape theory: the cliff of worst-case exponential
performance remains very real — as our hours-long <code>pip</code> runs
illustrate. Worse, the <abbr>NP</abbr>-completeness of the problem domain
becomes a barrier to developing other tools, such as our dependency checker.</p>

<p>During development of some of the gnarlier analysis code in our dependency
checker, I was seriously exploring the feasibility of extending a symbolic
reasoning engine with a theory of version numbers. When that seemed a tad
impractical for a weekend project, I started looking for package management
algorithms that trade a reasonable loss in constraint expressivity for a gain in
guaranteed performance. Lo and behold, I found Go’s module system, which
restricts the expressivity of version constraints to no more than what’s
required and gains predictable results computed in time linear to problem size
in return.</p>

<p>But before it gets better, it gets a whole lot worse.</p>

</figure>

<p>The above xkcd comic provides an approximate map of possible Python
installations for a computer. In doing so, it also provides a first indication
that Python’s package ecosystem is quite a bit more complicated than others. In
fact, if anything, the above map is too simplistic. Python has <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#installation-paths">six
officially supported installation schemes</a>, each of which comprises eight
different paths. So-called <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/">virtual
environments</a> modify those paths even further and cross-compiling between
environments is possible only <a
href="https://discuss.python.org/t/towards-standardizing-cross-compiling/10357/23">with
officially unsupported hacks</a>. The difficulties don’t stop there. Additional
complicating factors, roughly ordered from less to more severe, include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Version numbers have <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/">several
uncommon attributes</a>, notably epochs and post releases, that complicate
reasoning about versions without providing any additional expressivity.</li>

<li>Version constraints support an uncommon operator, the <a
href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#arbitrary-equality">arbitrary
equality</a> operator <code>===</code>, that has Python semantics and thus is
hard to model outside a Python interpreter.</li>

<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/#environment-markers">Environment
markers</a> further constrain requirements to, say, specific Python versions,
Python interpreters, or operating systems. The number of distinct such
environments deepens the complexity of dependency analysis.</li>

<li>Version numbers have no semantics, <a
href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#version-scheme">only an ordering</a>.
While that fulfills the minimum requirements for version satisfiability being
computable, it also does not help with gauging the impact of any version
increase. That, in turn, results in highly confusing scenarios — such as the one
described above, where a patch release of Python (3.8.10) contains a minor
release of <code>pip</code> (20.3) that includes a groundbreaking, completely
backwards-incompatible feature.</li>

<li>Packages traditionally do <em>not</em> include <a
href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/">their dependencies</a> with the
metadata. One must first download and build the package. This considerably slows
down version selection and wastes tremendous network and package registry
resources.</li>

<li>Packages traditionally specify their <a
href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html#transitioning-from-setup-py-to-setup-cfg">metadata
in code</a>, not in data. That makes it nearly impossible to extract the
metadata without running arbitrary code, including package-specific
plugins.</li>

</ul>

<p>What you get is a package ecosystem with a poor developer experience that
makes tool building much harder than necessary. Worse, the ecosystem saw few
improvements during Python’s “lost decade” — when most packages supported two
incompatible versions of the language and which lasted, roughly, from the first
production release of Python 3 in <time datetime=2008-12-03>December
2008</time> to the last production release of Python 2 in <time
datetime=2020-04-20>April 2020</time>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, things are improving as of late and the rate of improvement is
seemingly accelerating. Notably, support for <a
href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/">pluggable build backends</a> and the
definition of a more realistic <a
href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/">common metadata standard</a> are
significant steps towards a simpler Python package ecosystem.</p>

<p>Still, Python could do so much better if it rid itself of much of this cruft
more aggressively while also rethinking foundational aspects more radically.</p>

<p>The site-specific map-making effort <a
href="/blog/2022/your-own-kind-of-map">described in part two of this blog
series</a> will serve as partial proof of concept that doing so is feasible and
has significant upsides.</p>
