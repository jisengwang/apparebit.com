<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>On <time datetime=2019-03-19>19 March, 2019</time> in the early afternoon, I
was at my desk in the New York City engineering office of Meta née Facebook and
checking the status of my advertising campaigns. (Since I focus on events that
largely predate the rebranding, I’ll stick with Facebook.) As an advertising
company, Facebook encourages its employees to conduct their own advertising
campaigns and supports those efforts with monthly advertising credits. I had
been using those credits to boost posts on Instagram, while also experimenting
with the composition of target audiences. Since advertising metrics still felt
somewhat alien to me despite more than six months at the firm, I decided to look
up basic metrics, notably <em>ad impressions</em>, on the firm’s wiki. I was
about to discover compelling evidence that Facebook was artificially inflating
that very metric and thereby misleading paying customers, investors, and
regulators alike.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=public>
<h2 id=public>First Impressions</h2>

<p>Before we get to what I found, let’s make sure we understand what ad
impressions are and what role they play in Facebook’s business.

To get started,
we turn to the <cite>Facebook Business Suite</cite>. The smartphone app is an
indispensable tool for creating and monitoring ads on Facebook. In <time
datetime=2021-10-27>October 2021</time>, the app’s builtin help defined ad
impressions thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The number of times your ads were on screen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, an impression happens only when an ad is displayed on screen.
That makes sense. But it also leaves unspecified who, if anyone, looks at that
screen. Let’s dig a little deeper. Since Facebook is a publicly traded company,
it must make regular filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or
<abbr>SEC</abbr>. Those filings matter because they help investors and
regulators understand a company’s business as well as evaluate its future
prospects.</p>

<p>The quarterly and yearly reports covering the day I made my discovery are <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680119000037/fb-03312019x10q.htm">Form
10-Q</a> as filed with the <abbr>SEC</abbr> on <time datetime=2019-04-25>April
25, 2019</time> and <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326801/000132680120000013/fb-12312019x10k.htm">Form
10-K</a> as filed on <time datetime=2020-01-30>January 30, 2020</time>. Both
filings contain a section titled <cite>Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations</cite> and a subheading
<cite>Components of Results of Operations — Revenue</cite>. That’s where the
firm’s management, foremost <abbr>CEO</abbr> Mark Zuckerberg, spell out how they
understand the business they are in and how that business generates its revenue.
The first two paragraphs, labelled <em>Advertising</em>, are identical in both
filings and read (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our
advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook,
Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile
applications. <em>Marketers pay</em> for ad products either directly or through
their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, <em>based on the
number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks,
taken</em> by users.</p>

<p>We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the
contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. <em>Impressions are
considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user.</em> We recognize
revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user
takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is
subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and
the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue
divided by the number of ads delivered, <em>representing the effective price
paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as
impression or action</em>. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not
the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short: Facebook generates almost all revenue through advertising, which
maximizes either impressions or actions. Impressions requires display of the ad
to human users. Impressions also are the more fundamental metric, with price
per impression reported for all ads.</p>

<p>Two years later, the firm’s <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680122000018/fb-20211231.htm">most
recent Form 10-K</a>, filed with the <abbr>SEC</abbr> on <time
datetime=2022-02-03>February 3, 2022</time>, includes a whittled down first
paragraph only but the three points still are the substance of Facebook’s
explanation for its revenue.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=internal>
<h2 id=internal>Actual Impressions</h2>

<figure class=figure>
<img width=1200 height=630 src="/blog/2022/wrong-impression-1200x630.jpg"
     alt="A computer screen showing Facebook’s internal wiki on ad impressions">
<figcaption>An impressive definition of impressions.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Alas, Facebook’s actual, technical definition for ad impressions is
substantially different:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook uses a specific definition for an external impression: the number of
times a unit was on screen. This is technically defined as 1x1 pixel of a post
or piece of content in a user’s viewport, for >0 than seconds. (We don’t reveal
this definition externally.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definition remains Facebook’s actual definition for ad impressions to
this day. The only thing that has changed is that Facebook started <a
rel=noreferrer
href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/785455638255832">sharing that
definition</a> with the outside world in <time datetime=2019-09>September
2019</time>. That page has an embedded view counter, but with today’s count at
928 smaller than the 1,381 on my last visit on <time
datetime=2021-10-31>Halloween last year</time>, I have some reservations about
the counter’s accuracy. Still, that page does not seem particularly popular or
easy to find. I couldn’t. Experienced staff at the New York Times did.</p>

<p>By comparison, the Media Rating Council (<abbr>MRC</abbr>), an
industry-funded, self-regulatory organization, states in its <cite>Viewable Ad
Impression Measurement Guidelines</cite> for <a
href="https://mediaratingcouncil.org/sites/default/files/Standards/062816%20Mobile%20Viewable%20Guidelines%20Final.pdf">mobile</a>
as well as <a
href="https://mediaratingcouncil.org/sites/default/files/Standards/081815%20Viewable%20Ad%20Impression%20Guideline_v2.0_Final.pdf">desktop</a>
that its <em>viewable ad impressions</em> require showing at least 50% of the
ad’s pixels for at least 1s. It also requires that the ad delivery system tracks
non-viewable as well as undetermined ad impressions in addition to viewable ones
and that all three be disclosed to advertisers.</p>

<p>That same organization has also <a rel=noreferrer
href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/567955163586463?id=354406972049255">accredited
Facebook</a> for its handling of ad impressions in the newsfeeds of the Facebook
and Instagram social networks. However, the accreditation only covers its
minimum standards, which do not specify any quantitative thresholds.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=mine>
<h2 id=mine>Analytical Impressions</h2>

<p>Facebook’s technical definition of ad impressions comprises only 50 words.
But when you consider context and implications, they have tremendous impact.
Let’s explore just that impact.</p>

<ol class=drop-count role=list>

<li>There is no plausible technical reason that might justify this definition.
Determining the visible rectangle of some view element is straight-forward for
applications running on the <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19032261/how-to-get-scroll-views-visible-rectangle-frame-after-it-scrolls-in-ios">iOS</a>
and <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9073677/android-get-the-visible-area-of-a-view">Android</a>
operating systems. It used to be slightly more complicated for <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/123999/how-can-i-tell-if-a-dom-element-is-visible-in-the-current-viewport">web
browsers</a>. But that has become straight-forward too.</li>

<li>This definition gives Facebook tremendous latitude in delivering ad
impressions. In the worst case for advertisers, Facebook claims that it
delivered some number <var>n</var> of ad impressions, when in manifest reality
it delivered only <var>n</var> corner pixels. Then again, maybe the firm did
deliver <var>n</var> complete ad impressions. The technical definition renders
ad impressions useless to advertisers.</li>

<li>At the same time, the one-square-pixel threshold for ad impressions is
exceedingly useful to Facebook. The firm invariably records more ad impressions
because not all ads need to be fully visible in order to qualify. But that is
only the baseline, best-case scenario. If Facebook decided to exploit that
definition, it has tremendous opportunities for artificially inflating ad
impressions even further.</li>

<li>Taken together, the first three analytical impressions point towards
economic self-interest as primary motivating force, even if that includes
cheating on its paying customers. The definition’s parenthetical only
strengthens that interpretation. Why else add such suggestive language? Worse,
the very presence of the parenthetical on a widely accessible wiki page points
to a firm culture largely unencumbered by ethics or even scruples.</li>

<li>Facebook has definitely exploited this definition — to a degree that (some)
advertisers noticed. I am confident of that because of a <time
datetime=2019-06>June 2019</time> conversation with another software engineer,
who used to work on Google’s ad team. When I told the story of the
one-square-pixel threshold, the engineer seemed unimpressed, responding: “We
long suspected that!” Apparently, some Facebook customers could not make sense
of reported numbers and took their complaints to the competition.</li>

<li>Yet in conversations with journalists and lawyers about the technical
definition, I received feedback that (unnamed, presumably institutional)
advertisers were also unimpressed. That puzzled me for the longest time — until
I started looking into ad verification. After a <time
datetime="2016-09-22">September 2016</time> Wall Street Journal article about
Facebook <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-overestimated-key-video-metric-for-two-years-1474586951">miscalculating
a key video metric for two years</a>, Facebook reviewed its own metrics
collection and found <a
href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/complete-list-facebooks-misreported-metrics-and-what-they-mean">several
more metrics that were faulty too</a>. To <a
href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/facebook-commits-third-party-audit-provides-new-ad-options">reassure
the advertising industry</a>, the firm agreed to an <abbr>MRC</abbr> audit and
installed data taps for third-party ratings firms. The implication now is
obvious: Institutional advertisers aren’t particularly concerned about Facebook
(possibly) cooking the books because they have their own, independent
books.</li>

<li>That still leaves one sizeable group of advertisers who remain fully exposed
to Facebook’s mostly arbitrary ad impressions: individuals and small businesses.
They do not have the resources to pay for third-party verified metrics. They
most likely do not even have the awareness that anything might be amiss. After
all, Facebook doesn’t exactly highlight the technical definition and continues
peddling its fantasy of meaningful ad impressions in advertising platform and
regulatory filings. Given that context, Facebook using “<a rel=noreferrer
href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/speaking-up-for-small-businesses/">Speaking
Up for Small Businesses</a>” as the public relations angle in a recent fight
with Apple, which has Facebook opposing a move by Apple that meaningfully
improves privacy, truly strains credulity.</li>

<li>Facebook subjecting itself to an outside audit and providing ratings firms
with direct data taps in early <time>2017</time> was unexpected. After all, this
is the same firm that last year fought academic researchers and journalists
monitoring political advertising on Facebook by <a
href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/09/21/facebook-rolls-out-news-feed-change-that-blocks-watchdogs-from-gathering-data">disabling
their tools</a> as well as by <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/opinion/facebook-misinformation.html">deplatforming
the auditors</a> — despite or more likely because of the intense public interest
in that work. Upon reflection, however, the opposite reactions are perfectly
consistent with a single imperative: to protect the thin patina of legitimacy
that remains of the firm’s reputation and, more importantly, its economic
self-interest at all costs.</li>

</ol>

<section aria-labelledby=conclusion>
<h2 id=conclusion>Personal Impressions</h2>

<p>So what are we to make of all this?</p>

<p>To me personally, the most infuriating aspect of discovering the technical
definition was the parenthetical. I would read the technical definition two
years later and reliably, immediately feel an immense anger building up inside.
That co-opting “we” of the ethically compromised who don’t share externally was
truly triggering because deeply insulting. With some more distance, I can attest
that the technical definition and its parenthetical are incredibly sleazy
indeed. But in motivating me to leave Facebook again, it also served a positive
function. Three months later I declared: “So long, and thanks for all the
gelato!” That’s the only positive thing about my nine months with the firm.</p>

<p>Facebook’s handling of ad impressions is yet another instance where the firm
seeks advantage for itself with no regard whatsoever for the consequences on
others. But it doesn’t stop there. If it wasn’t for third-party ratings firms,
the technical definition would render the most foundational metric of its
advertising platform meaningless. That’s how far Facebook will go for extracting
more and more profits, to turn even its own business into one ginormous scam —
and to do so despite the fact that the legitimate version of its micro-targeting
ad delivery system produces astounding profits already.</p>

<p>That institutional advertisers didn’t want to get involved in a quarrel that
doesn’t impact them directly seems reasonable only for a moment. But then the
naked self-interest becomes readily apparent because institutional advertisers
can’t trust Facebook either. It’s just that the current arrangement meets their
needs and they don’t want to upset the status quo. As it turns out, the sleazy
reputation of the advertising industry really is earned. In that, Facebook and
its largest customers are made from the same tempting but cheaply spun cloth
that might just rip at any moment or leave a chemical burn on your skin. They do
deserve each other.</p>

<p>Finally, we can, with some confidence, point towards the one force that
eventually will consume Facebook whole: Facebook itself. We got a first taste
of just that eventuality in recent weeks, when Zuckerberg’s obsession with the
metaverse turned into plans to <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse">spend
$10 billion just this year</a> and no end to the unhinged spending in sight
thereafter. That hubris rightly spooked investors, triggering a major stock
sell-off on <time datetime=2022-02-03>February 3, 2022</time> that knocked a <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/facebooks-232billion-drop-in-value-sets-all-time-record.html">record-setting
$232 billion</a> off Facebook’s market value just that day. The stock has lost
another 13% of its remaining value or $86 billion since then.</p>

<p>I would lie if I claimed that I didn’t feel some <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">Schadenfreude</a> at this
turn of events. But the thing is, if I was Mark Zuckerberg, I’d probably try to
build the metaverse as well. Because when I look at the totality of his record
and the ghosts of the many who died <a
href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/08/how-facebook-is-complicit-in-myanmars-attacks-on-minorities/">in
Myanmar</a> and <a
href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjbpd7/how-facebook-is-stoking-a-civil-war-in-ethiopia">in
Ethiopia</a> stare accusingly back, I too would want to escape myself into the
metaverse!</p>
