<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>On <time datetime=2019-10-23>23 October, 2019</time> Mark Zuckerberg
testified before the House Financial Services Committee. An exchange between Rep
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Mr Zuckerberg about fact-checking organizations
didn't sound quite right to me at the time, so I set out to fact-check Mr
Zuckerberg’s claims.</p>

</section>

<section aria-labelledby=the-testimony>
<h2 id=the-testimony>The Testimony</h2>

<p>The <a
href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?465293-1/facebook-ceo-testimony-house-financial-services-committee&start=15784&end=15834">relevant
exchange</a> lasts a mere 50 seconds and comprises only two short questions with
their similarly short answers. The transcript by <a
href="https://epublications.marquette.edu/zuckerberg_files_transcripts/1035/">The
Zuckerberg Files</a> reads:</p>

<p><b>A Ocasio-Cortez</b>: That’s all right. I’ll move on. Can you explain why
you’ve named The Daily Caller, a publication well-documented with ties to white
supremacists, as an official fact-checker for Facebook?</p>

<p><b>M Zuckerberg</b>: Congresswoman, sure. We actually don’t appoint the
independent fact-checkers. They go through an independent organization called
the Independent Fact-Checking Network that has a rigorous standard for who they
allow to serve as a fact-checker.</p>

<p><b>A Ocasio-Cortez</b>: So you would say that white supremacist-tied
publications meet a rigorous standard for fact- checking? Thank you.</p>

<p><b>M Zuckerberg</b>: Congresswoman, I would say that we’re not the one
assessing that standard. The International Fact-Checking Network is the one who
is setting that standard.</p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby=the-facts>
<h2 id=the-facts>The Facts</h2>

<p>I wasn’t the only person who took note of that exchange. Mother Jones
published <a
href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/aoc-zuckerberg-facebook-congress-daily-caller-fact-check-dodge/">an
article</a> that <time datetime=2019-10-23>same day</time> explaining how Mr
Zuckerberg’s answers to Rep Ocasio-Cortez were “misleading at best.” Mr
Zuckerberg described fact-checker selection as a process completely outsourced
to and under the control of <a href="https://www.poynter.org">The Poynter
Institute</a>, a nonprofit, self-described “school for journalists.” However, in
reality, Facebook <a
href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/2/18522758/facebook-fact-checking-partnership-daily-caller">selects
fact-checkers themselves</a> while also requiring their vetting by the Poynter
Institute. In fact, Facebook appears highly selective, partnering with only six
out of 62 accredited fact-checkers at the time.</p>

<p>Mr Zuckerberg nicely illustrated the benefits of this arrangement during the
above exchange. When confronted with pointed questions, representatives for the
firm can point to an established outside party for deflecting responsibility. <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/13/they-dont-care-facebook-fact-checking-in-disarray-as-journalists-push-to-cut-ties">In
the succinct words</a> of a former managing editor at Snopes, a well-known
fact-checker that <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211031112802/https://www.snopes.com/2019/02/01/snopes-fb-partnership-ends/">ended its
partnership</a> with Facebook in <time datetime=2019-02-01>February 2019</time>:
“[Facebook] essentially used us for crisis <abbr>PR</abbr>.” Still, the
appointment of a fact-checker with ties to white supremacists seems sufficiently
extraordinary to explore why such an organization would go through the rather
rigorous accreditation process of the Poynter Institute and how it would find
itself amongst the very few official fact-checkers on Facebook.</p>

<p>First, the primary benefit of accreditation are the much improved
opportunities for spreading propaganda and lies. That sounds like an
impossibility at first because even a bad-faith fact-checking organization is
constrained by the facts. To preserve credibility as well as accreditation, it
must largely arrive at the same conclusions others would when evaluating the
same claims. However, that leaves considerable discretion in <a
href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/2/18522758/facebook-fact-checking-partnership-daily-caller">selecting
claims for fact-checking</a>. In the attention economy of social networks, that
editorial power outranks even the content. Repeatedly covering a topic, say,
Hillary Clinton’s emails, can create an admittedly vague association with
impropriety despite stated conclusions to the contrary. After all, where there’s
smoke, there usually is also fire. Even covering a topic at all, say, the latest
vaccine conspiracy, can elevate fringe voices that otherwise would be completely
ignored.</p>

<p>Second, The Daily Caller’s subsidiary became one of only six fact-checkers
parternering with Facebook because Joel Kaplan, an experienced right-wing
operative and the firm’s head of public policy, wanted them on-board and Mark
Zuckerberg agreed with him. The relevant two paragraphs in a <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-lonely-conservative-takes-on-a-power-position-11545570000">Wall
Street Journal profile of Kaplan</a> read:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-lonely-conservative-takes-on-a-power-position-11545570000">
<p>This summer, Mr. Kaplan pushed to partner with right-wing news site The Daily
Caller’s fact-checking division after conservatives accused Facebook of working
only with mainstream publishers, people familiar with the discussions said.
Conservative critics argued those publications had a built-in liberal bias.</p>

<p>Mr. Kaplan argued that The Daily Caller was accredited by the Poynter
Institute, a St. Petersburg, Fla.-based journalism nonprofit that oversees a
network of fact-checkers. Other executives, including some in the Washington,
D.C. office, argued that the publication printed misinformation. The contentious
discussion involved Mr. Zuckerberg, who appeared to side with Mr. Kaplan, and
Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The debate ended in November when The
Daily Caller’s fact-checking operation lost its accreditation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last sentence requires clarification: <a
href="https://www.ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/profile/check-your-fact">According
to the Poynter Institute</a>, the fact-checking operation was placed “under
review” in <time datetime=2018-11-30>November 2018</time> because it failed to
properly disclose the organizations employing fact-checkers. It was restored to
good standing in
<time datetime=2019-02-19>February 2019</time> and, having passed two more reviews
since, remains in good standing to this day.</p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby=the-consequences>
<h2 id=the-consequences>The Consequences</h2>

<p>Clearly, Mr Zuckerberg materially misrepresented the arrangement between
Facebook and independent fact-checkers when answering Rep Ocasio-Cortez during
his congressional testimony. Since he actively participated in the discussions
about partnering with The Daily Caller’s fact-checkers and eventually approved
of that arrangement, it would also appear that Mr Zuckerberg knowingly and
willingly misrepresented the facts. He may not have been under oath that day,
but <a
href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/is-zuckerberg-under-oath-congress/">materially,
knowingly, and willingly misrepresenting yourself</a> to the executive,
legislative, or judicial branches of the federal government is a felony.</p>

<p>When the rich and powerful abuse their position to mislead both government
and public, as Mr Zuckerberg apparently did on <time datetime=2019-10-23>October
23, 2019</time>, they gain undue advantage that only increases their already
tremendously privileged position. They also erode the people’s faith in this
country’s institutions and its founding as a nation of law. That makes such
conduct particularly pernicious and it rightly is <a
href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/law-lying-perjury-false-statements-and-obstruction">subject
to severe sanction</a>, including imprisonment for up to five years. The above
facts more than justify an official investigation into whether Mr Zuckerberg’s
testimony did in fact violate the law.</p>

<p>Please contact your representatives and urge them to start that investigative
process. It is long overdue!</p>
