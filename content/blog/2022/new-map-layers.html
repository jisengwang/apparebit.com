<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the final post in a three-part series on the wondrous world of
package management. <a
href="https://apparebit.com/blog/2022/your-own-kind-of-map">Catch up on post #2
here</a> if you missed it.</p>

<p>So far along our journey through the world of package management, we’ve
stayed focused mostly on the major technical challenges. For most of us software
engineers, that falls squarely within our comfort zone and we might be tempted
to stay put. That would be a major mistake.</p>

<p>If you tried to identify what makes Go’s package ecosystem simpler and more
usable, you’d probably start by listing some technical achievements: first, Go’s
package manager has the benefit of hindsight after observing the consequences of
building on an <abbr>NP</abbr>-complete package resolution algorithm. Second,
Go’s alternative algorithm is <a
href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-mvs#theory">a genuinely clever one</a> that
maximizes what’s possible with a linear time algorithm.</p>

<p>But neither point comes close to explaining why Go’s approach works in
practice and has been accepted by its community. To do that, you’d have to look
at the social practices around maintaining and consuming software packages —
which inform the design of Go’s package ecosystem throughout.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll shift away from the mostly technical discussion and
instead talk about two additional map layers in the world of package management:
the social and economic considerations. Both layers cover the entire world of
package management and hence are critical for understanding it. They differ in
that social aspects serve as dragonbane, whereas economic aspects serve as
dragonwort.</p>

</figure>

<p>In part two, you’ll recall that we built a dependency checker to identify
version constraints in our repositories, and that we got pushback within the
team against fixing every single affected repository. That contention deserves
further exploration because, by focusing on what matters, we hopefully can draw
a better map of package management. That way, we might just be able to follow
the footsteps of Anaximander, who over 1,110 years <em>before</em> Isidore of
Seville drew a map of the world that is significantly more accurate and detailed
— as you can see in the contemporary reconstruction to the side. The center of that map
happens to be Miletus, Anaximander’s home.</p>
</div>

<p>Package management became a thing <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager#History">during the early
days of open source</a>, between 1993 and 1994 <abbr>CE</abbr>, largely as a
more humane alternative to building software yourself and for the FreeBSD,
Linux, and OpenBSD operating systems as well as the Perl programming language —
all of which are open source. Open source software eliminates some aspects of
commercial software distribution, such as payment processing or copy protection,
that significantly complicate the latter. But it also requires significant user
expertise, involves many more stakeholders across many more organizations, and
has attendant technical, operational, legal, and economic risks. With this
understanding, package managers primarily help with coordination and risk
management. It’s only by doing so that they enable the fine-grained composition
of software components (“packages”).</p>

<p>In other words: <em>Package managers are tools for addressing social
problems</em>!</p>

<p>In his <a
href="https://medium.com/@sdboyer/so-you-want-to-write-a-package-manager-4ae9c17d9527">blog
post on package management</a>, Sam Boyer presents package managers as tools
that seek to minimize harm in the presence of significant risks and
uncertainties. He builds on <a
href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/11/18/harm-reduction-for-developers/">a blog
post</a> by Julia Evans, which probably first applied the concept of
<em>harm reduction</em> to software development practices. Harm reduction is the
proven public health practice that seeks to make undesired outcomes from, say,
recreational drug use, more unlikely instead of rigidly rejecting anything but
abstinence as acceptable behaviors. Boyer argues that’s also the primary
function of a package manager.</p>

<p>While I believe that Evans and Boyer make a convincing case, I would like to
offer a second, complementary perspective: package management is an exercise in
communicating and managing expectations. When compared to other engineering
disciplines, software development stands out for its constant and far more rapid
change. So a primary criterion for development tools is whether they help manage
that change and isolate humans from negative consequences as much as
possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic versioning</a> is a great example of a
convention that does just that: a patch release implies a bug fix, a minor
version release implies new features, and a major version release implies
backwards-incompatible changes. But communicating the latter is not enough:
backwards-incompatible changes are almost guaranteed to cause significant work
and disruption. Go’s package manager builds on that insight and shifts some of
the pain of major version releases back to where it belongs: to the package
maintainers instead of the package consumers.</p>

<p>The contrast to Python’s package ecosystem is stark. Many of the standards
for Python’s package ecosystem, including those for version numbers and
constraints, really are piecemeal green-field exercises in specification writing
that aren’t anchored in practical requirements but optimize for abstract notions
such as extensibility and flexibility. That’s bad enough but, worse, the
maintainers of the primary package manager, <code>pip</code>, do not even use
their own tool.</p>

<p>The practice of using one’s own tools — so-called <em>dog-fooding</em> — is
an important systems-building practice because it provides the developers with
feedback early and often. I have certainly used it while building <a
href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1133981.1133987">my parser generator
featuring modular syntax</a>. It is also used by cargo, the package manager for
Rust; maven, the package manager for Java; as well as npm and yarn, the package
managers for JavaScript. It is a tremendous missed opportunity for
<code>pip</code>’s developers and it probably explains many of the peculiarities
and pathologies of the Python package ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id=dragonwort>Dragonwort: Economic Considerations</h2>

<figure class=figure>
<img src="/blog/2022/maps/hecataeus.svg" alt="A far more accurate representation of the Mediterranean and Black Seas with surrounding lands">
<figcaption>Hecataeus’ map, 550–476 <abbr></abbr>BCE (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hecataeus_world_map-en.svg">Wikimedia</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We are on a roll mapping out the non-technical challenges of package
management. So in the spirit of Hecataeus — who significantly improved on
Anaximander’s work in mapping the world around Miletus, again shown in a
contemporary reconstruction — it’s time to explore economic aspects of package
management.</p>

<p>Most package ecosystems don’t just trade in open source projects but also do
so under the permissive <a
href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"><abbr>MIT</abbr></a> and <a
href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0">Apache 2.0</a> licenses —
reaching almost 63% of packages, <a
href="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/resources/blog/open-source-licenses-trends-and-predictions/">according
to one recent survey</a>. That makes using these same open source packages an
attractive proposition for corporations as well. As a direct result and not
surprisingly, package managers have become a standard tool for software
development in general. To leverage this critical infrastructure for commercial
software development, enterprises such as Enigma interface with the commons
through a private proxy that is backed by the public registry. Internal packages
are published to the proxy only, which ensures that they remain invisible to the
outside world.</p>

<p>For instance, our small business data processing pipeline integrates 220
external open source Python packages that way — 63 of which are direct
dependencies of our internal tasks and libraries. The relatively small number of
external dependencies probably is a result of our pipeline using a few huge
packages, including NumPy, Pandas, and PySpark that cover most needs.
Furthermore, Python developers thankfully don’t tend to follow the micro-package
dogma of, say, Node.js’ package ecosystem. For comparison, I wrote the custom
static website generator for my personal website — a much simpler piece of
software — in Node.js and very much sought to minimize external dependencies,
preferring to code as much as I could myself. Yet my static website generator
still requires 375 external packages.</p>

<p>That a gift economy would become foundational to the hyper-capitalist
technology industry is nothing short of astonishing. It certainly helps that,
thanks to the unprecedented rate of change in computing technology, source code
by itself, when not maintained by engineers, rapidly diminishes in economic
value. At the same time, the contrast between the collaborative open source
commons and the highly competitive industry it enables has also resulted in <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2021/03/01/elastic-war-on-amazon-web-services/?sh=19cd49673dbf">contentious
and even exploitative practices</a>. One outcome is that relatively simple
or low-level libraries serving as convenient but nonessential building blocks
are shared liberally — hence the increasing fraction of packages using
permissive open source licenses. Yet complete and sophisticated services such as
databases or search engines are shared only <a
href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/the-crusade-against-open-source-abuse/">under
newly restrictive licenses</a>.</p>

<p>Some developers of open source software <a
href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/some-developers-are-fouling-up-open-source-software/">are
increasingly chafing</a> at these economic disparities and have taken to <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704022108/https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/issues/1046">sabotaging
their own packages</a>, for example, by removing all source code from the
repository or by replacing a package’s functionality by something less useful if
not outright dangerous. That has resulted in considerable disruption especially
within the Node.js ecosystem — with much anger directed at responsible
developers. Personally, I can empathize with the frustration felt by developers
protesting against such exploitation and also by developers cleaning up the
resulting messes. But therein lies the rub: the pain of disruption caused by
developers who protest is largely felt by other package developers—not by the
company executives and venture capitalists who are empowered to correct the
disparities.</p>

<p>Thankfully, a well-designed package manager can help you mostly avoid
confrontation with these particular dragons. However, npm did not. Its
centralized registry saw <a
href="https://changelog.com/posts/npm-keep-running-keep-awesome">a tenfold
increase</a> in load from November 2012 to October 2013. It almost broke the
ecosystem at that time. The unique solution taken by npm’s primary developer and
copyright holder of the source code was to create a company backed by venture
capital. That worked for a while but caused significant strife several years
later. <a href="https://changelog.com/founderstalk/61">npm Inc’s former
<abbr>CEO</abbr> tells one story</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/ceejbot/economics-of-package-management">npm Inc’s
employee #2 tells quite another</a>. Both are very interesting. In contrast,
the design of Go’s package ecosystem dispensed with package distribution for its
registry. That significantly reduces operating costs and eliminates one source
of contention.</p>

<p>Alas, by now, 2022 <abbr>CE</abbr>, the npm registry and much of the code for
the Go programming language are at least mirrored by Microsoft’s GitHub, the
most popular open source commons. Microsoft is also responsible for the
development of the most popular open source <abbr>IDE</abbr>, Visual Studio
Code, as well as the most popular cross-platform application runtime, Electron.
For good measure, it optionally ships the Linux open source operating system as
a subsystem of Windows. If you knew the Microsoft of the late 1990s and early
2000s, that’s quite a turnaround. In any case, it means that all software
development now critically depends on Microsoft.</p>

<p>Then again, when you consider that the Olympic mountains to the west of
Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, <abbr>WA</abbr> and the Cascade mountains
to the east make for ideal dragon breeding grounds, that development isn’t too
surprising.</p>

<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Across a series of <a href="/blog/2022/mapping-package-management">three</a>
<a href="/blog/2022/your-own-kind-of-map">blog</a> <a
href="/blog/2022/new-map-layers">posts</a>, I made four major points:</p>

<p>First, it is possible to rein in dependency hell, even in Python, and without
a monorepo. It took us only a little more than 2,600 lines of code (not counting
tests).</p>

<p>Second, building a package ecosystem on an <abbr>NP</abbr>-complete version
satisfiability algorithm is madness, especially now that we know a much better
alternative. If you are involved in maintaining a package manager, it’s time to
switch to Go’s much saner design.</p>

<p>Third, while we software engineers love to engineer ourselves out of every
challenge, we’d be well-advised to be more cognizant of social and economic
factors first. They make a huge difference.</p>

<p>Finally, we address interesting engineering challenges here at Enigma. You

dependency checker tool or the writing of this series. Enigma practices a strict
