<p>These days, reports about Israel’s annihilation of Gaza and its population
seemingly cannot do without the obligatory quote by Israel’s prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu that “total victory” is the only option for Israel going
forward. He has been <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Atimesofisrael.com+netanyahu+%22total+victory%22">saying
so repeatedly</a>, including in
<a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-hezbollah-playing-with-fire-attacks-will-be-met-with-much-stronger-fire/"><time
datetime="2023-11-13">November 2023</time></a>,
<a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-vows-total-victory-against-hamas-says-pa-rejects-israel-cant-rule-gaza/"><time
datetime="2023-12-03">December 2023</time></a>, <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/after-icj-ruling-pm-says-israel-in-just-war-against-hamas-will-fight-until-total-victory/"><time
datetime="2024-01-26">January 2024</time></a>, and <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-those-telling-us-not-to-enter-rafah-are-essentially-saying-lose-the-war/"><time
datetime="2024-02-17">February 2024</time></a>. While the Hebrew phrase has also been
translated as “absolute” or “complete victory,” <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3D6GGxNsMn/">the prime minister’s
Instagram account</a> uses “total victory.” Judging by the
<cite>Financial Times</cite>’ <time datetime=2024-02-11>February 11</time>
headline that “<a
href="https://www.ft.com/content/b0fc46cc-5585-4255-a23f-aab044148a7d">War on
Hamas unites Israelis in quest for ‘total victory’</a>,” the vast majority of
Israelis seem to agree with their prime minister, though the article provides
only minimal anecdotal evidence in support of that claim. Meanwhile, <time
datetime=2024-02-10>a day earlier</time>, John Bolton, an American with a long,
distinguished career as warmonger, left no doubt about his favoring “total
victory” in an opinion piece for <cite>The Telegraph</cite> titled “<a
href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/10/two-state-solution-dead-israel-must-achieve-total-victory/">The
two-state solution is dead. Israel must achieve total victory.</a>”</p>

<p>To me, the use of the phrase “total victory” is extremely troubling for its
historical associations. In German, total victory is <i lang=de>der totale
Sieg</i>, which reminds of and even rhymes with <i lang=de>der totale Krieg</i>.
The latter phrase is the more infamous one, seeing that it is the topic of Nazi
Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels’ <time datetime=1943-02-18>February 18,
1943</time> speech in Berlin’s Sportpalast. The speech is noteworthy in part
because Goebbels almost came out publicly for the <i lang=de>Ausr…
Ausschaltung</i> of Jews—stopping himself just barely from saying <i
lang=de>Ausrottung</i>, that is, extermination, and switching to <i
lang=de>Ausschaltung</i>, elimination, instead. But the moment that turned the
speech into one of the more notorious events of the Third Reich comes towards
the end when Goebbels calls out to the audience, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRmHOSnehTk">asking whether they want
total war</a>, and the crowd ecstatically agrees.</p>

<p>Now, my associating <i lang=de>totaler Sieg</i> with <i lang=de>totaler
Krieg</i> is no accident. If you look at <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/WolltIhrDenTotalenKrieg/GoebbelsJoseph-Rede-WolltIhrDenTotalenKrieg194315S._djvu.txt">the
text of Goebbels’ speech</a>, he is careful to introduce total victory as part
of his case for total war. It provides the very goal and justification for total
war. Unfortunately, that particular passage is sloppily translated <a
href="https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/goeb36.htm">in the
English version</a> and doesn’t even use “victory.” But even if one missed the
introduction of total victory, the frenzy of Goebbels’ calls and audience
responses towards the end leaves little doubt. He starts the back-and-forth
with: “<i lang=de>Glaubt Ihr mit dem Führer und mit uns an den endgültigen
totalen Sieg des deutschen Volkes?</i>” That is: “Do you join the Führer and us
in believing in the final total victory of the German people?” By his fifth
question the crowd is in a frenzy. So when he asks: “<i lang=de>Wollt Ihr den
totalen Krieg?</i>” or “Do you want total war?” the crowd goes ballistic in
response. The implication is clear as well: Total victory requires total
war.</p>

<p>That implication still holds, even if Netanyahu and others assiduously avoid
mentioning total war nowadays. The very concept of total victory demands total
war. After all, the totality of victory also is the totality of an enemy’s
defeat. But how can one be really sure that the enemy is totally defeated,
especially when the enemy is known to hide in the crowd, also in tunnels
underground, only to suddenly, sneakily attack? There is only one reliable
answer: Killing every single member of Hamas. But how can one be really sure
that all members of Hamas have been killed when they hide in the crowd, also in
tunnels underground? Again, there is only one reliable answer: Treating all
Palestinians in Gaza as likely members of Hamas and also destroying all
underground tunnels.</p>

<p>If that sounds a bit much to you, consider what senior members of Netanyahu’s
government have been saying: Months before the <time
datetime=2023-10-07>October 7</time> pogrom, the national security minister
called for the <a href="https://thecradle.co/articles-id/18">killing of
“thousands” of Palestinians</a> in the West Bank. <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/gaza-nakba-israels-far-right-palestinian-fears-hamas-war-rcna123909">Since
the pogrom</a>, the agriculture minister welcomed “Gaza’s Nakba,” using the
Arabic equivalent to Shoah, catastrophe</a>, the heritage minister suggested
dropping a nuclear bomb onto Gaza, and the finance minister called for the
creation of “sterile” zones. Netanyahu himself <a
href="https://www.salon.com/2023/11/13/bibi-netanyahus-bible-lessons-how-hes-selling-gaza-to-jewish-and-christian-far-right/">reminded
the public of Amalek</a>, a nation in Scripture that, after attacking the
Israelites, was fully razed from Earth—with <i lang=he>יהוה</i>’s blessing
nonetheless.</p>

<p>Now, against that backdrop, look at facts on the ground in Gaza. Alas, since
Israel also controls much of the information flow out of Gaza, we need to <a
href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2024-02-08/ty-article-static-ext/.premium/gazans-fled-their-homes-they-have-nowhere-to-return-to/0000018d-73f0-d4f1-a18d-f7f071190002">leverage
satellite imagery</a> to see the devastation. Residential homes, universities,
mosques, hospitals, streets, power plants, desalination plants, wastewater
treatment plants, farmland, and even cemeteries. They all have been bombed and
bulldozed. Again, even farmland and cemeteries are being <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-maps.html?smid=url-share#jan-bulldozing">systematically
leveled</a>. The devastation is near total in the North. In the South, Rafah is
still, kind-of standing. It also is where most Gazans are <a
href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2024-01-19/ty-article-magazine/.premium/a-million-people-satellite-images-reveal-massive-tent-city-in-southern-gaza/0000018d-1cce-d022-ad9d-1efee5760000">subsisting
in tent cities</a>, after having been driven out of their homes and, for many,
out of their first, second, and third refuge as well. Meanwhile Netanyahu has
already announced his intent to turn Rafah into rubble, too—after <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-plans-to-move-rafah-civilians-to-15-tent-cities-along-the-coast-report/">displacing
civilians yet again</a> to 15 tent cities along the coast.</p>

<p>As a German living in the United States, I am incensed by both countries’
governments, which blithely deny the obvious: This is not a “normal” war, this
is total war and the results are near total destruction, obscene numbers of
civilian casualties, <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-says-gaza-death-toll-at-28858/">almost
29,000 so far</a>, <a
href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4473673-gazas-health-care-crisis-is-horrifying-and-getting-worse/">rampant
disease</a> and <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/29/briefing/gaza-food-crisis.html">hunger</a>.
All of this is intentional. We heard Netanyahu: He is going for total victory.
He is committed to total war. He is committing genocide. If Germany or the
United States were true friends of Israel, they would go out of their way to
stop Israel from doing what it is doing. In fact, they would do everything in
their power to stop this war because <em>friends don’t let friends commit
genocide</em>. Instead they approve record arms exports to Israel and provide
hands-on military aid. That makes the United States and Germany complicit in
genocide. And since I am a tax payer in the <abbr>US</abbr>, I’m complicit,
too.</p>

<p>The fact that Jews were the targets of one of the most atrocious crimes in
history, the industrialized extermination of a people, does not change that
Israel, the world’s only Jewish state, is currently committing genocide. Many
people seemingly cannot imagine that the descendants of survivors from one
catastrophe would one day become the perpetrators of another catastrophe. Hence
<a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/andrew-sullivan-israel-gaza-children">Andrew
Sullivan lists many of the same statements and facts</a> only to declare that
“this is not genocide” and that “the charge of genocide seems to me
inflammatory, even grotesque.” I find it curious that Sullivan would use
“grotesque” to describe a reasonable assessment about the war in Gaza but not
for the total war effort itself. Still, I readily acknowledge that the Shoah is
in a different league of evil. But that hardly makes a difference to the 29,000
dead Gazans and their surviving families, who have lost everything besides maybe
a bag full of belongings. It is telling that even Sullivan describes the
devastation in Gaza as worse than that of Coventry and Dresden, two of the
cities worst impacted by <abbr>WWII</abbr>, because Gazans have nowhere to
escape, that even Sullivan writes of ethnic cleansing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile justifications for the current catastrophe have become so hollow
and inhuman to be risible. There is the deeply cynical trope that Hamas, by
hiding within and under the civilian population, is forcing Israel’s hand and
the Israeli Defense Forces cannot but go through them. That’s the equivalent of
arguing—if Gaza was a bank, Hamas were bank robbers, and the civilian population
hostages—to first shoot every single hostage dead, so that the police can more
easily take out the bank robbers. Worse are the appeals to Jewish victimhood.
After South Africa submitted its case to the International Court of Justice,
Netanyahu <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-world-courts-handling-of-false-genocide-claims-shows-holocaust-lessons-not-learned/amp/">used
a press conference</a> on <time datetime=2024-01-27>Holocaust Remembrance
Day</time>
to blast Hamas as “the new Nazis,” while holding up an Arabic translation of
Hitler’s <cite>Mein Kampf</cite> (see above), and accusing everyone else
including South Africa but excluding, presumably, himself of not having learned
the lessons from the Shoah. Yet he is the one using Goebbels’ warmongering and
dehumanizing language to justify the total war he is literally leading.</p>

<p>Alas, the world hasn’t learned the lessons from the Shoah. The banality of
evil is that every single one of us is capable of terrible crimes against
humanity. We all are capable of slouching towards genocide. Netanyahu and his
posse of far right extremists have already proven they are more than capable.
Hamas are at least as capable and quite a bit more craven when they murder
ravers at a music festival, when they brutally violate women before murdering
them, and when they hold civilians as hostages. But then again, Netanyahu <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68318856">left Hamas in
power</a> because they provided the cover he needed for rejecting a Palestinian
state and continuing to grow illegal settlements in the West Bank. Netanyahu
also <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html">ignored
emphatic warnings</a> that Hamas was about to strike because he was busy
dismantling Israeli democracy. So who is more craven here? I’m genuinely not
sure.</p>

<p>This madness must stop. We need somebody with credibility to step up to the
plate and set a sign that is hard to ignore. Unfortunately, some of the
institutions that might have been able to do so in the past, including the
United States and the United Nations, are too compromised to do so now. In my
mind, that somebody might be Yad Vashem, Israel’s memorial to the Shoah. They
should declare that, henceforth, they will devote all their prestige and
resources to documenting the Nakba as much as the Shoah and to tracing the
history from both catastrophes to the current one. That acknowledgment of
traumatic suffering just might provide the foundation for future understanding
and reconciliation, even if it takes a couple of generations. Alas, with a
leader who used to represent settlers and an official policy of staying out of
politics, I fear that Yad Vashem are content to offer historically accurate
horror shows for school classes on day trips. That would be a crying shame. The
lessons from the Shoah require action. Now!</p>
