<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>I recently read a <a href="https://ra.co/features/3215">report about a
creative retreat in Bethlehem</a>, just outside the Israeli West Bank barrier.
While the report was earnestly trying not to be prejudiced let alone incendiary
and the same seemingly holds for the retreat, a slight pro-Palestenian bias was
nonetheless clearly discernible throughout the report. To some degree, I can
appreciate that. After all, the situation in the West Bank increasingly
resembles that of South Africa during apartheid and Gaza increasingly functions
as the largest prison compound in the world. But stating the obvious is not
going to contribute anything to our understanding of this conflict. At the same
time, that obvious state of affairs has resulted in Israel becoming the target
of much opprobrium and protest in the West, which many Israelis experience as
fundamentally antizionist and antisemitic.</p>

<p>That puts myself in an increasingly untenable position because, as a German
who grew up with the history of the Shoah, I also strongly believe in Israel as
a Jewish state and abhor any expression of antisemitism. As it happens, a small
detail in the above mentioned report caught my attention and, after some
research, forcefully reminded me of the unfairness of singling out Israel when
every single country sharing a border with Israel is so much worse. That does
not make Israel’s behavior towards the Palestinians any more
right or righteous. I continue to strongly oppose the far right and in the long
term exceedingly harmful policies of current and possibly future prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. But it does help in calibrating how we express criticism of
the current Israeli government and in resisting the pull of becoming yet another
partisan in this conflict.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=pop-music-as-threat>
<h2 id=pop-music-as-threat>Pop Music as “Threat”</h2>

<p>The starting point for this rather unusual perspective on Israel and its
neighbors is comparably frivolous, seeing that it concerns a pop music group.
The group in question is called Mashrou’ Leila, hails from Lebanon, is wildly
popular all across the Middle East, and happens to be fronted by a gay singer,
Hamed Sinno. I can personally attest that their music is deeply compelling,
thanks to great melodies and Sinno’s soulful singing. Since I don’t speak
Arabic, I must rely on others who report that the band’s <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2016/06/22/483096040/mashrou-leila-tiny-desk-concert">lyrics
may celebrate clubbing and nightlife</a> as much as <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/19/537923929/songs-we-love-mashrou-leila-roman">they
reflect the perspective</a> of <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/mashrou-leila-and-the-nightclubs-political-power">women,
gays, and transgender people</a>. They also are full of double entendres that
often reference Arab literature. In other words, the band’s name is program: It
alternately translates as Night Project and as Layla Project, with the latter
being the female protagonist of “<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layla_and_Majnun">the Romeo and Juliet of
the East</a>.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mashrou’ Leila is facing a dilemma: The band has pretty much
run out of locations to perform, at least in the Middle East. Let’s explore the
countries, one by one:</p>

<ol class=drop-count>
<li><em>Syria</em> is out of question since there is hardly any Syria left after
almost nine years of civil war. Bashar al-Assad’s regime was already considered
to be one of the most brutal in the world before the civil war, but his
persistence and cruelty in that war forever marks him as one of the worst rulers
in modern history. Consequently, it is exceedingly bitter irony that he may just
win this war thanks to intervention by Russian forces and withdrawal of American
forces.</li>

<li><em>Jordan</em> officially banned Mashrou’ Leila in <time>2016</time> due to
the group’s “<a
href="https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2016/04/27/475905478/jordan-reportedly-bans-band-with-gay-frontman-from-performing">political
and religious beliefs and endorsement of gender equality and sexual
freedom</a>.” That ban went into effect just days before Mashrou’ Leila was to
perform at the Roman amphitheater in Amman, where they had played three times
before. Jordan, in case you don’t remember, is an absolute monarchy, whose queen
dowager Noor Al-Hussein is a familiar face in the West seeing that she was born
in Washington <abbr>DC</abbr> and loves to be feted for her environmental
engagement.</li>

<li><em>Egypt</em> officially banned Mashrou’ Leila in <time>2017</time>
after a concert in Cairo, at which seven male audience members unrolled rainbow
flags. Officially, homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt and neither are rainbow
colored flags. In reality, <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/world/middleeast/egypt-mashrou-leila-gays-concert.html">seven
men were arrested right after the show</a> and subjected to a ”forensic medical
examination to determine if they have had anal sex.” Another attendee was
entrapped on a dating app that night and sentenced to six years of imprisonment
for “debauchery” by the following Tuesday. Altogether, over the following weeks,
<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/world/middleeast/egypt-gay-suicide-sarah-hegazi.html">at
least 75 people were arrested and sentenced</a> to between one and six years of
prison. Meanwhile, the deputy of the Syndicate of Musical Professions, which
issued the ban, called the band’s music “<a
href="https://egyptianstreets.com/2017/09/25/the-syndicate-of-musical-professions-bans-mashrou-leila-from-performing-in-egypt-again/">abnormal
art</a>.” That would be exactly the same phrase as used by Germany’s Nazis when
banning art they didn’t appreciate.</li>

<li><em>Lebanon</em> has not yet officially banned Mashrou’ Leila. However,
their last show at last summer’s Byblos International Festival had to be
cancelled after fundamentalist Christians <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/middleeast/mashrou-leila-canceled-byblos-festival-intl/index.html">were
literally preparing to kill every single attendee at that arts festival</a>. It
is unclear how being a mass murderer, even after maliciously distorting the
meaning of song lyrics to say something offensive, is compatible with a religion
whose Ten Commandments include “Though shalt not kill.” But such minor details
of everyday religious practice clearly do not factor in with this particular
grouping of, well, terrorists. By cancelling the show instead of arresting the
terrorists, the Lebanese government has made clear that they too view a pop band
as the bigger threat. In fact, fearing arrest, Sinno left Lebanon for the United
States during those events and has been living in the country since.</li>
</ol>

<p>So here we are. A popular music group from Lebanon apparently threatens the
repressive regimes of the region to such a degree that it too must be silenced,
that attendees of their shows must be locked up in jail, and that keeping the
peace with religious terrorists is more important.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=not-in-israel>
<h2 id=not-in-israel>Not in Israel</h2>

<p>Now, some of you might observe at this point that there still is one more
country in the region I have not yet discussed. That country is of course
Israel. It changed its British-influenced penal code in <time>1988</time> to
decriminalize being gay. The first gay pride parade in Tel Aviv took place in
<time>1993</time>. By <time>2000</time>, the parade had evolved from a political
event to a street celebration and entertainment event. In <time>2008</time>, the
festivities included the opening of Israel’s first <abbr>LGBT</abbr> center.
Approximately <a
href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Tel-Aviv-Pride-Parade-kicks-off-for-21st-time-with-theme-The-Struggle-Continues-592539">250,000
people attended the week-long celebration in <time>2019</time></a>. And
approximately <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/over-200000-attend-tel-aviv-gay-pride-parade-30000-from-abroad/">30,000
international visitors attended in 2018</a>. In short, Israel has a lively and
open gay, lesbian, and transgender community. It also enjoys wide-ranging
support in the population, with both city of Tel Aviv and Israel’s Ministry of
Tourism supporting the yearly Gay Pride festivities.</p>

<p>Surely then that Mashrou’ Leila would be welcome to perform in Tel Aviv. I
have no doubt that they would be and suspect that they already have a
significant local fan base. But as it is, the band’s members must not even
contact a person who is an Israeli citizen, resides in Israel, or works for an
Israeli organization. That is because Lebanon’s criminal code of
<time>1943</time> forbids any contact between Lebanese citizens and citizens of
an enemy state. The Anti-Israeli Boycott Law of <time>1955</time> further
specifies that Israel is just that, an enemy state. To make these laws worse,
<a
href="http://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/reportsfeatures/the_rules_of_lebanese-israeli_engagement__">they
apply globally</a>, covering any <a
href="http://www.thetower.org/article/dreaming-of-a-lebanon-completely-at-peace/">interaction
between a Lebanese citizen and somebody else</a>. Lebanon also does not
recognize a change in citizenship, including someone rescinding Lebanese
citizenship. I have been unsuccessful in finding specific information on
potential penalties for violating these more than sixty year-old laws. But from
all discussions I did find online, they are serious and include prison
time.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, these laws are enforced inconsistently. This has led to
<a
href="https://stateofmind13.com/2013/01/20/whats-the-legal-limit-of-cyber-lebanese-israeli-contact/">Lebanese
bloggers publicly questioning</a> the reasoning behind these laws. But as Miss
Lebanon <time>2014</time> found out, fame or fortune may not necessarily spare
you from these laws. The Lebanese government started an official investigation
into the young woman’s behavior when an Instagram picture emerged showing her
with three other contestants, all smiling for the camera. The problem: One of
the other three young women was Miss Israel <time>2014</time>. Miss Lebanon’s
explanation that she was “photobombed” by a nefarious Miss Israel and thus could
not do anything about it seems a bit of a stretch to me looking at the image.
But who am I to argue with an obviously smart young Lebanese woman, who had to
<a href="https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/8952/lebanon-israel">suffer through
the indignities of being photobombed</a> and <a
href="https://blogbaladi.com/miss-lebanons-selfie-photo-bombed-by-miss-israel/">then
having her patriotism questioned</a>.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=in-context>
<h2 id=in-context>Stop Singling Out Israel!</h2>

<p>That brings us to the closing of this essay. I am ending with an appeal for
moderation when criticizing Israeli policy towards Palestinians and the
country’s displays of crushing might. It’s hard not to care for the underdog in
that fight and I strongly believe that Israel must find a better way of coping
with Palestinians. The status quo is not just untenable on its optics and its
human rights, it also endangers the very state of Israel because it undermines
international support.</p>

<p>But the status quo in the countries surrounding Israel is not only untenable
but much worse. One neighbor is a failed state laying in rubble. Two more
neighbors are oppressive dictatorships, one under the banner of monarchy and the
other under the banner of the military. Pathetically, they are so threatened by
a pop band they needed to ban it. One of them even locked up some fans. Finally,
the fourth neighbor has the semblance of a democracy, but its government prefers
to appease religious terrorists instead of defending a pop music show. It also
has the most repressive laws in the region when it comes to its own people
interacting with their neighbor, despite there not being a war. So if you are
calling for a boycott of the West Bank, shouldn’t you be calling for a boycott
of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt too? The official regimes in those
countries clearly lack legitimacy and have much worse human rights records.
Plus, they are so pathetic they are scared of a pop band. In other words, a
boycott might just change something. How about that?</p>
