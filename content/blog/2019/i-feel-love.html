<p>Sam Sweetie, Smith Dahlin’,</p>

<p>We gotta talk. You just released a cover version of <cite>I Feel Love</cite>,
Donna Summer’s utterly transcendental disco anthem, that is so faithful a clone
that it lacks anything and everything a good song let alone a great cover should
have. I am talking about human emotions, feelings, a soul. Your cover version
has none. It’s devoid of anything even remotely resembling the qualities that
make music so central to our lives, that drive us onto the dance floor, and that
let us dance the night away. In the words of Resident Advisor’s Andrew Ryce,
it’s a “<a href="https://ra.co/reviews/24422">transparent, disrespectful cash
grab.</a>” He wisely recommends the 1985 cover by Bronski Beat and Marc Almond
as a much better alternative. In fact, I have been listening to both <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm-ISatLDG0">the original</a> and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnDwCZ3aZ3k">the Bronski Beat/Almond
cover</a> while writing this open letter. (There also is <a
href="https://patrickcowley.bandcamp.com">Patrick Cowley’s</a> magnificent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ocq8UlLuuw">remix of the song</a>,
which for many a connoisseur <em>is</em> the song.) I just hope they cleanse my
palate and help forget ever having listened to your version.</p>

<p>Now Sam Sweetie, there’s nothing wrong with being in business with Target.
They may even pay you well, Smith Dahlin’. That’s ok. Me, myself, and I, we love
shopping at Target. They are across the street from my home and have most
everyday supplies at good prices. Unlike the unrepentant blasphemers, heretics,
and idolators at <abbr>CBN</abbr>, who like to scream “Target at It Again,
Pushing Pro-<abbr>LGBT</abbr> Agenda,” I am aok with Target’s support for the
community. Frankly, all corporations should. It’s smart business. But therein
lies the rub. Target is nothing but a smart capitalist enterprise, hawking its
wares to all paying customers, including us <abbr>LGBT</abbr> folk.</p>

<p>Worse, Sam Sweetie, you are not content to release this utterly hollow,
utterly insincere cover of <cite>I Feel Love</cite> in support of Target’s
latest and greatest advertising blitz and thereafter be done with that. No,
Smith Dahlin’. You have the <a
href="https://twitter.com/samsmith/status/1190132105650429958?lang=en">audacity
to declare</a>: “As a queer person, <cite>I Feel Love</cite> has followed me to
every dance floor in every queer space from the minute I started clubbing.”
Really? So how come your cover version is so shitty, vocal acrobatics
notwithstanding? Given your stories about coming out as gay aged 10, about
wearing make-up to school — not just any school, Catholic school — given your
more recent declarations of being a feminist and genderqueer, I would have hoped
that you have a better sense for what it means to be <abbr>LGBTQ</abbr> — see, I
even added the Q so that you feel more welcome — and more respect for the
community, not taking us for patsies.</p>

<p>But fret not, Sam Sweetie. You picking <cite>I Feel Love</cite> also provides
a great learning opportunity about love and respect, Smith Dahlin’. See, many of
the men who originally danced the night away to Donna Summer’s sublime tunes are
dead, not from old age but from the plague. They died horrible deaths during the
1980s and polite society very impolitely chose to look away, pretending that
this was just desserts or something. Around that time, Donna Summer had become a
born-again Christian and hung out with a few too many of the above-mentioned
blasphemers, heretics, and idolators. And in 1983, at a performance in Atlantic
City, she said things that either were terribly misunderstood or terribly put.
I’m guessing it was a little bit of both. Many in the <abbr>LGBTQ</abbr>
community turned from her and disavowed one of the reigning queens of the dance
floor. Her career never recovered.</p>

<p>After her death in 2012, <abbr>POZ</abbr> Magazine <a
href="https://www.poz.com/blog/donna-summers-letter-to-act-up">published a
letter in full</a> that Donna Summer had written to apologize in 1989 and then
sent to <abbr>ACT UP</abbr>, as they were protesting outside her performances
all over the East Cost. It is heartfelt, sincere, full of pain, and full of
love. You’d do well to read it in its entirety and take it to heart. Because
despite all the moaning and groaning and the sultry lyrics, knowing that pain
and making it go away, if only for a song, is at very core of Donna Summer’s
glorious artistry. Don’t you ever dare to sully it again with such a cheap
stunt, you little bitch. Got that Sam Sweetie, Smith Dahlin’?!</p>

<p>In closing, here is Donna Summer in her own words — may she rest in love:</p>

<figure class=quote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have too many good memories together to live in this state of
unforgiveness. I never denied you or turned away, but in fact you turned away
from me. If I have caused you pain, forgive me. It was never my intention to
reject you but to extend myself in love. I know that some of you really need me
now because you’ve written and told me so. Can’t we just forgive each other for
this past confusion?</p>
</blockquote>
</figure>

<p>As far as I am concerned, the good memories together are what matters.
Indeed. You are forgiven!</p>

<p>With love,</p>
